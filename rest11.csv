1,1,1,4,0,0,0,"I really like Prep & Pastry - we have been twice in the last two months on a Sunday.  The best trick I learned is to put your name on the waitlist BEFORE YOU ARRIVE.  As long as you are within 5 miles of the restaurant, you can be added.  It is a great service.

I have tried a number of things for brunch and all have been excellent - even their sweets. I think my favorite is the breakfast sandwich.  I am not a big drinker, so I usually order the ice team and it really is better than almost anything else I have tried. 

Staff is really, really nice.  I highly recommend a visit if you are in town.",20/9/2017 18:19
3,3,1,4,0,0,0,"Tasty selection and very preppy! 

One cannot go wrong with the What's Up Doc omelet. One complaint with the omelets is the actual size, they seem to fluctuate. Clearly a difference in 4-5 extra bits worth of omelet. 

If you have a sweet tooth, any of french toasts are great! Fancy Breakfast Sandwich is great! I substituted the prosciutto with bacon and got great results! Great mimosas!",18/11/2015 20:39
6,6,1,5,0,0,0,"If you want to eat at Prep & Pastry on the weekends, go right when it opens or before it closes. There is always a long wait because of how busy it gets - but the wait is always worth it. The food there is absolutely amazing. I go there often and love the green eggs & ham, bloody marys, and mimosas! They gave me a free pastry on my birthday once, it was delicious! I wish I remembered what it was called. 

I also love that they serve EXO coffee here (a local coffee) - nothing better than a great breakfast with great coffee to go with it!",4/1/2016 18:36

While it would do some good to have more shade on the patio it was still an enjoyable experience. They are pet friendly too!
We will be back!",19/4/2014 17:26
13,13,1,5,1,0,1,"This was a great place to have brunch with the family. It is very clean and the staff were great. I love the decor!! Plus, my four year old actually ate here!!! That is a HUGE deal. He doesn't like anything.",26/5/2015 18:10
15,15,1,4,0,0,0,"The food took forever- servers were really friendly, but they looked very unorganized. Example, after breakfast we asked for a heated cinnamon roll and it sat so long it got cold again lol. It was amazing though once we finally got it. The pork belly was great, eggs way undercooked. Overall, we might go back for a cinnamon roll to go, but not to eat, just not worth the waiting.",17/1/2016 17:16
16,16,1,4,0,0,0,"Long wait if you go on a weekend, but worth the wait. The potatoes are the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. Bacon was delicious as well. Both the smores and classic french toast were very good! Pricey, but worth it for special occasions.",19/2/2017 18:02
18,18,1,5,0,0,0,Absolutely amazing!! Cute little restaurant serving breakfast and brunch. They have a bunch of unique and tasty mimosas. Super cool atmosphere and decor. Food was extremely tasty. Awesome find during our short stay in Tucson!,7/4/2017 21:44

24,24,1,4,0,1,1,"YUM.

Literally that's all I can say about this place. I went twice in one weekend! I'm literally obsessed. So where do I begin?

The doughssants! Or cronuts, as some people prefer. How YUMMY. I had the cranberry and coconut one. They're very dense so get one BEFORE your meal bc I could only take one bite out of mine after I finished my grilled cheese. Oh man, that grilled cheese. They have a really unique blend of cheeses and pesto! Now I am not a pesto fan (I know, very strange) but it works great here! But the selling point is the tomato basil soup. Literally the BEST I have ever had and this is my favorite soup so I have tried it everywhere. The second time, I tried the classic breakfast: 2 eggs, any style (I opted for scrambled), country hash (delicious) and toast. This time I had my doughssant beforehand, s'mores flavored -- amazeballs. 

The space is very comfortable and beautifully decorated. The staff is extremely friendly always checking in with you and making light-hearted and sincere conversation. 

There is a wait to be seated. But you just have to stick it out because you don't want to miss out on this new restaurant. 

I'll be back when they get their liquor license business straightened out so I can sip on a mimosa while I enjoy my grilled cheese.",7/5/2014 20:31
25,25,1,5,0,0,0,By far the best brunch in Tucson. One of the rare places that serves a Bloody Mary with a beer back.  Service is consistently great. Expect a wait Friday-Sunday. Order the Benedict and the Madras mimosa.,14/1/2017 21:56
27,27,1,5,0,0,0,"My sister and I were visiting Arizona all the way from the east coast and our aunt and uncle brought us for breakfast today. Our server, Alma, was out of this world. She had an amazing, positive, and outgoing personality. From the moment we sat down, we felt at ease and comfortable. Her sense of humor kept us entertained and feeling welcome.  We couldn't asked for a better and more upbeat personality.  She definitely deserves positive accolades from all who work with her.  We can't wait to visit again! On top of this, the food here is phenomenal!",29/12/2017 17:52

Bloody Mary w a beer back and another one of their signature cocktails was only $12!!! The food was excellent, creative and hardy. A highlight of our trip to Tucson for sure!",28/7/2014 15:12
32,32,1,5,1,0,1,"Everything about this place is awesome.

We decided to go for Sunday brunch, and could not have been more pleased. We were initially concerned with the 25 minute wait outside, but were pleased when they called us after just 10 minutes. 

I had the French toast which was outstanding, and my sister ordered the grilled cheese, which was ""one of the best she's ever had."" 

The place was hopping, the staff was friendly, and they're very fast and efficient. Overall, AMAZING place to have breakfast in Tucson.",19/1/2015 0:26
38,38,1,4,0,0,0,"Have to say this hipster hangout surprised me. Love the decor. Easy and comfy. The menu is good. I got the special, chicken and toast. The blueberry topping was kinda bland, needed to be sweeter. The chicken had a nice surprising heat. The waiter, Joel, was good. Very knowledgable, well spoken, knew his menu. I love all the cocktails. The coffee comes hot or iced. Which is nice in Arizona. I love that they bring a big container of water to the table. Same with the creamer. They aren't cheap. Love that they are dog friendly.   Very nice brunch. Will be back and will bring people!!!",27/10/2014 19:28
43,43,1,2,2,0,0,"Food was nothing special. I think this place gets a lot of hype because they push alcohol really hard to make it have a fun vibe. I mean, it's not bad, but it's not worth the price either.",30/4/2017 17:23
45,45,1,5,0,0,0,"We had a wonderful breakfast here on a friends birthday. My food was really really good - had omelet and potatoes. Very interesting taste combination on the menu omelet. Can't recall the name. 
Companions had similar experiences. 
Service was very good. Pricing is fair.",28/8/2017 23:40
48,48,1,5,0,0,0,"My favorite spot for brunch and lunch! Be prepared to wait, but the wait is worth it. Friendly staff and terrific food more than make up for the delay... unless you're one of those posters who says ""Nobody eats there anymore - it's too crowded.""",9/9/2017 19:52
52,52,1,5,0,0,0,"I was in town for a mini-family reunion.  The desk clerk at the Hampton Inn recommended this restaurant.  It was great.  We did have to wait about 30 minutes for a table.  But that is because it is so perfect, everyone wants to eat there and never leave.  The staff encourages this relaxed feeling, we never felt pressure to eat and run.  Instead they offered frequent top-offs for our coffee and water.  
Dana, our server, patiently explained the specials (a few times over) cause we couldn't make up our minds.  She made sure that the decaf crowd and non-decaf crowd were served correctly.  Also, she gave a more than accurate description of all of the menu items.  She was super welcoming and gracious even though the restaurant was busy.  
The food choices fit everyone's needs; savory or sweet, veggie or not.  Interesting combinations of old and new.  I had the Mac, egg whites, veggie sausage, spinach, etc.  It was very tasty and filling.  Also, appetizingly presented on the plate.  
Others in my party had variations of French toast and omelets.  Tasted the French toast and was in heaven.  All food arrived promptly and at once.  A request to cook a dish a little bit more was handled with ease.  If I had more room I would have had one of the pastries which looked delicious!
Thanks to all at the Prep & Pastry for making our family feel very specially treated and welcome.",23/2/2016 18:14
