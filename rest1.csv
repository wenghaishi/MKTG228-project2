1,1,1,4,0,0,0,"I really like Prep & Pastry - we have been twice in the last two months on a Sunday.  The best trick I learned is to put your name on the waitlist BEFORE YOU ARRIVE.  As long as you are within 5 miles of the restaurant, you can be added.  It is a great service.

I have tried a number of things for brunch and all have been excellent - even their sweets. I think my favorite is the breakfast sandwich.  I am not a big drinker, so I usually order the ice team and it really is better than almost anything else I have tried. 

Staff is really, really nice.  I highly recommend a visit if you are in town.",20/9/2017 18:19
3,3,1,4,0,0,0,"Tasty selection and very preppy! 

One cannot go wrong with the What's Up Doc omelet. One complaint with the omelets is the actual size, they seem to fluctuate. Clearly a difference in 4-5 extra bits worth of omelet. 

If you have a sweet tooth, any of french toasts are great! Fancy Breakfast Sandwich is great! I substituted the prosciutto with bacon and got great results! Great mimosas!",18/11/2015 20:39

There is always a long wait because of how busy it gets - but the wait is always worth it. The food there is absolutely amazing. I go there often and love the green eggs & ham, bloody marys, and mimosas! They gave me a free pastry on my birthday once, it was delicious! I wish I remembered what it was called. 

I also love that they serve EXO coffee here (a local coffee) - nothing better than a great breakfast with great coffee to go with it!",4/1/2016 18:36

15,15,1,4,0,0,0,"The food took forever- servers were really friendly, but they looked very unorganized. Example, after breakfast we asked for a heated cinnamon roll and it sat so long it got cold again lol. It was amazing though once we finally got it. The pork belly was great, eggs way undercooked. Overall, we might go back for a cinnamon roll to go, but not to eat, just not worth the waiting.",17/1/2016 17:16
16,16,1,4,0,0,0,"Long wait if you go on a weekend, but worth the wait. The potatoes are the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. Bacon was delicious as well. Both the smores and classic french toast were very good! Pricey, but worth it for special occasions.",19/2/2017 18:02

24,24,1,4,0,1,1,"YUM.

Literally that's all I can say about this place. I went twice in one weekend! I'm literally obsessed. So where do I begin?

The doughssants! Or cronuts, as some people prefer. How YUMMY. I had the cranberry and coconut one. They're very dense so get one BEFORE your meal bc I could only take one bite out of mine after I finished my grilled cheese. Oh man, that grilled cheese. They have a really unique blend of cheeses and pesto! Now I am not a pesto fan (I know, very strange) but it works great here! But the selling point is the tomato basil soup. Literally the BEST I have ever had and this is my favorite soup so I have tried it everywhere. The second time, I tried the classic breakfast: 2 eggs, any style (I opted for scrambled), country hash (delicious) and toast. This time I had my doughssant beforehand, s'mores flavored -- amazeballs. 

The space is very comfortable and beautifully decorated. The staff is extremely friendly always checking in with you and making light-hearted and sincere conversation. 

There is a wait to be seated. But you just have to stick it out because you don't want to miss out on this new restaurant. 

I'll be back when they get their liquor license business straightened out so I can sip on a mimosa while I enjoy my grilled cheese.",7/5/2014 20:31
25,25,1,5,0,0,0,By far the best brunch in Tucson. One of the rare places that serves a Bloody Mary with a beer back.  Service is consistently great. Expect a wait Friday-Sunday. Order the Benedict and the Madras mimosa.,14/1/2017 21:56

She had an amazing, positive, and outgoing personality. From the moment we sat down, we felt at ease and comfortable. Her sense of humor kept us entertained and feeling welcome.  We couldn't asked for a better and more upbeat personality.  She definitely deserves positive accolades from all who work with her.  We can't wait to visit again!

We decided to go for Sunday brunch, and could not have been more pleased. We were initially concerned with the 25 minute wait outside, but were pleased when they called us after just 10 minutes. 

I had the French toast which was outstanding, and my sister ordered the grilled cheese, which was ""one of the best she's ever had."" 

The place was hopping, the staff was friendly, and they're very fast and efficient. Overall, AMAZING place to have breakfast in Tucson.",19/1/2015 0:26
38,38,1,4,0,0,0,"Have to say this hipster hangout surprised me. Love the decor. Easy and comfy. The menu is good. I got the special, chicken and toast. The blueberry topping was kinda bland, needed to be sweeter. The chicken had a nice surprising heat. The waiter, Joel, was good. Very knowledgable, well spoken, knew his menu. I love all the cocktails. The coffee comes hot or iced. Which is nice in Arizona. I love that they bring a big container of water to the table. Same with the creamer. They aren't cheap. Love that they are dog friendly.   Very nice brunch. Will be back and will bring people!!!",27/10/2014 19:28

52,52,1,5,0,0,0,"I was in town for a mini-family reunion.  The desk clerk at the Hampton Inn recommended this restaurant.  It was great.  We did have to wait about 30 minutes for a table.  But that is because it is so perfect, everyone wants to eat there and never leave.  The staff encourages this relaxed feeling, we never felt pressure to eat and run.  Instead they offered frequent top-offs for our coffee and water.  
Dana, our server, patiently explained the specials (a few times over) cause we couldn't make up our minds.  She made sure that the decaf crowd and non-decaf crowd were served correctly.  Also, she gave a more than accurate description of all of the menu items.  She was super welcoming and gracious even though the restaurant was busy.  
The food choices fit everyone's needs; savory or sweet, veggie or not.  Interesting combinations of old and new.  I had the Mac, egg whites, veggie sausage, spinach, etc.  It was very tasty and filling.  Also, appetizingly presented on the plate.  
Others in my party had variations of French toast and omelets.  Tasted the French toast and was in heaven.  All food arrived promptly and at once.  A request to cook a dish a little bit more was handled with ease.  If I had more room I would have had one of the pastries which looked delicious!
Thanks to all at the Prep & Pastry for making our family feel very specially treated and welcome.",23/2/2016 18:14

57,57,1,5,0,0,0,"Excellent breakfast fare. I have been there twice and I am hooked. I tried their new omelette with mozzarella cheese, and the salmon beni. Both were great. 

My only recommendation to the owners is to get an espresso machine and add espresso based drinks to their menu. That should be an easy addition and would really complement their offerings very well!",7/11/2017 3:10

68,68,1,3,1,0,0,"So after a 30 minute plus wait for Saturday brunch I was excited just to sit down. They had water at the table and two glasses filled, luke warm tap water. So let's just say I couldn't be happier to get my mimosa which was pretty tasty. That waiter Jonathan was great very attentive and friendly. I ordered a Monte cristo, French toast honey roasted ham, mascarpone and pineapple I couldn't wait to dig in. My boyfriend ordered salmon Beni and it looked fabulous. Just as I took a bite of my sandwich which was great  my boyfriends facial expression changed as he pulled a long piece of blond hair from his food. Needless to say we were done, however they did comp our meal and gave us a few free doughssants.  They were very apologetic about the incident.

70,70,1,3,0,0,0,"We were in from out of town and went here due to the reviews and awesome looking pastries. We waited about an hour to be seated. There were times when quite a few tables were open at a time. Now, I've been a waitress before and am aware that you don't want to be double or triple seated. But, if it was that bad maybe more staff/waiters would have helped. Our waitress on the other hand was nice but seemed to be very overwhelmed. We were asked three times of we wanted anything to drink. We ordered the poutine fries and the egg breakfast, as well as one of the doughnut-croissant in the peanut butter churro flavor. The poutine fries were really good!! My husband enjoyed them. The egg breakfast was good too! Bacon was crispy and thick! My favorite. My eggs came out over easy when I asked for over hard. Oh well... The pastry was good, not the best. We did wait a while for the food and for the check so the waitress was nice enough to bring a pastry for free. We took it to go and it was good. But I will say the next time we visit Tucson we probably won't be stopping by.",17/6/2017 18:46

73,73,1,3,4,0,0,"I was all too underwhelmed by Pre and Pastry. My amazing fiancï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½e and I went there for breakfast one day with high expectations! I love a good breakfast and am a picky eater. I understand that not everywhere has something I love, but I remained hopeful!
The inside is darling and has a promising ambiance. We were sat at a tiny table that was incredible unstable. Once we had our waters and coffee the table was nearly full and very shakey. Our server was an awkward girl who wouldn't look us in the eyes. 
I ordered the sweet potato hash with no eggs and my fiancï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½e had duck fat gravy with biscuits. My meal had little to no flavor and I ended up using tobasco to make it resemble tasting like something. My Fiancï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½e said his meal had no flavor and was greasey. 
Maybe if we ordered differently, we could really like the place, but we are turned off by it n",27/10/2014 23:48
76,76,1,4,0,0,0,"The place is wonderful.  The food is excellent.  Though if you plan on going during the weekend, try to get there right at 8:00.  I had a party of five and got there around 8:25 and had to wait 20+ minutes to be seated.  I found it interesting that the staff chose to sit a group of 3 in an area that could have sat 6+.

Again, the Brunch was amazing and our waitress was the nicest waitress we've had in recent memory.  I've been there for brunch and for lunch.  Its the best.

Though, the teenager hostesses need to figure out how to distribute guests better.  But what do you expect?  They're probably U of A students.",13/7/2014 22:10

The sand which alone is what will bring me back to try the rest of the menu, the biscuits where delicious and the gravy was good. 

Only thing that i wasn't impressed by was the Danish, I ordered the berries and cream cheese Danish and it seemed very plain and didn't stand out what so ever.

The menu takes classic dishes, and brings them into a league of their own - in great and unique ways. The coffee from Tucson roasters EXO, is an compliment the delicious breakfasts. The staff is fantastic, the environment equally excellent, and the ability to experience all of this, in one of Tucson's true gems - is one you will not want to miss. It is also one of the rare restaurants in the new Cronut (croissant/donut) movement that has been sweeping the nation - that actually does it uniquely, and well (though they are called 'doissants' at Prep, due to the fact the Frenchman who invented the 'Cronut' has a copyright on that specific naming of this pastry revelation). It is essential to get on of these if you go, whose flavors rotate everyday - and offer 2-3 different varieties, each day.

I like this place so much that when I met U.S. men's soccer captain Clint Dempsey, I had only two things to say to him:

1) I enjoyed watching you in the world cup
2) You should go to Prep and Pastry while you are in town training.

138,138,1,5,1,0,1,"This is one of my favorite places in Tucson. We frequently bring out of town guests here for breakfast and brunch. It gets busy if you don't go early but it is worth the wait. The decor and general feel of the place is so cozy and comfortable yet very cool and stylish, be it the patio or sitting inside. And unlike most breakfast places you can order a drink at their bar while you wait for your table. The staff is very attentive and friendly, I am always very pleased. They are knowledgable and always so warm and welcoming to our out of town guests. The drinks are very well made. The Bloody Mary is the best in town in my opinion. It's has great spices on the rim, has some bacon, cheese, and olives as a garnish and comes with a small glass of their coffee stout. That tastes great to offset the spice of the drink between sips or I like to pour it in and mix it. All the food I have tried I love. I personally go back and fourth between the brick confit hash or the sweet potato hash as my favorites. But the salmon benni, the breakfast sandwich, their French toast, we're all ones I'd gladly eat again. Their pastries and unlike so many in Tucson. Obviously thoughtfully done with fun flavors.

159,159,1,5,1,0,1,"I just wrote another review titled ""getting it wrong.""

This review is called ""getting it so so so SO right.""

Today was my third visit to Prep and Pastry.....in one week.
I read the reviews, prepared to be disappointed by the hype, and was not. There is typically a wait on the weekends (I have heard anywhere form 40 to 90 minute waits) so we chose to go weekdays.

Our first visit was to a very busy restaurant; however, we were seated and sever quite promptly. We started out with a maple dossant. My husband lovedddd it and I really liked it. It was just a precursor of the good things to come. The coffee was ""expensive"" on the menu. When we tasted  and drank the coffee we knew why. 
1. it is exo and majorly delicious 
2. They keep the refills coming
3. They offer to go cups

I ordered the banana foster filled french toast and the hubby got the poutine.
Delicious does not even describe the meal. I am not normally one to order sweets but the description reeled me and I am very thankful for that. 

On our second visit we got a little unlucky. They ran out of the cinnamon dossants from the time we sat to ordered. Okay, take two. They ran out of the blueberry earl grey scones in time we made the second order and he got behind the counter. Take three we ordered the snicker doodle cookie because we could see a dozen. It was delicious. I switched my order this time and ordered the pork belly beni and my husband got the am relleno. One of the things my husband remarked about was the size of the pepper (quite small). Turns out this was not a normal size as (without mention or prompt from us) a side of potatoes arrived at the table with someone (Manger? Owner?) telling my husband that the peppers were not up to their standards  and to please have some potatoes. My beni was actually kind of cool and while still good, I can only imagine how it would have been hot. I was overall happy with our meal and service when our server gave us as bonus cookie since we had a bit of bad luck on our visit. My husband raved about the initiative taken by the restaurant.

Today we returned and chose the french toast stuffed with berry compote and the tri tip sandwich. We also finally got to try the cinnamon sugar dossant. Amazing amazing amazing. I have loved most of the dishes and the two today did not disappoint. i was pretty jealous of the tri tip and will definitely be getting it the next time I am there (which will undoubtedly be soon).

I ordered a side of walnut bread which came with fresh whipped butter and fresh jam on the side. It was delicious. My sister ordered two eggs with homefries and toast which she enjoyed and finished the whole plate.

This place wowed me from the moment I walked in. Cute industrial/farmhouse decor. We opted to sit inside, but their outdoor seating is nice as well. Especially since the weather is nice, and it is next door to a lovely antique shop. :)

My friend and I  both ordered the corned beef hash w/ gnocci and sweet potato puree. This definitely isn't the kind that comes from a can!  It was DELICIOUS! Soft and succulent corned beef accompanied by deep fried gnocci.  It also came mixed w/ Brussels Sprouts, and a perfectly cooked egg. The sweet potato puree perfectly balanced out the saltiness of the corned beef. I already dream about going back! Maybe tomorrow?! Haha. My other friend ordered the Pork Belly Beni. Beni, as in eggs Benedict. It came on a decadent cheese biscuit. I tasted it, and loved it as well. We will definitely be back soon! 

Service was friendly and helpful.  He was attentive, but not annoyingly so. My friend and I wanted to order some pastries to go, but were worried that they would sell out of the kind we wanted. Our server was nice enough to box up a croissant and coconut lime dossant (a.k.a. cronut) for us.

We frequent this place at least twice a month if not more and in the last few months things have not been to the standard they usually are. Staff less attentive, sloppy even, it took almost 15 minutes for toast in a relatively slow atmosphere compared to the usual bustle that is Prep. And although the lox plate is out of this world, 2 oz of salmon seems very little for a ""Lox"" driven plate and when we asked for more of the fish (happy to pay more as well) it took an additional 15 minutes because (as our waiter informed us) it depended on the ""chef's mood"". 

Again, I want to say we LOVE this place and have a lot of respect for the owner and the staff and for the quality of food we get to eat but lately things have seemed ""off"" ... I hope this just serves as feedback not empty criticism.

Being extra hungry, as one usually gets when on vacation, I ordered what I thought to be too much food, and basically ate it all 'cuz it was that good. You can get the chili French toast and you will be pleased with the salty sweetness combo, as other yelpers mention, you can try their take on the doughnut/croissant hybrid  the ""dossant,"" which is pretty good, however, someone in your party HAS to order the grilled cheese - preferably YOU! Ordering this grilled cheese sandwich has been one of the best (top ten) decisions I've ever made! This buttery, crispy, and gooey asiago bread one-ups your childhood favorite with pesto smeared in between its slices and topped off with a warm little squishy tomato. The creaminess of the white cheddar mixed in with the smokiness of the tomato make this vegetarian sandwich taste as rich as if you're eating bacon! Dunk it in the tangy tomato bisque, and take a big bite of Prep's garlicky herby roasted potatoes, and just sit there taking all of the goodness in.

The Breakfast Poutine: (4 / 5 Stars) The real highlight of today's brunch was my friend's Breakfast Poutine - I stole a few bites. The Poutine had a rich flavor and was very satisfying. 

The Duck Confit: (? / 5 Stars) Did not try but was told that the dish tasted great. 

Smoked Salmon Beni: (0 / 5 Stars) Although I was looking forward to my dish, the Smoked Salmon Beni was a huge disappointment. Not only was the salmon in small supply, it tasted like over-cooked frozen salmon rather than smoked salmon as advertised (definitely not a deal with the $12.00 price tag that comes along with it). Even though the eggs, potatoes, and other fixings of the dish tasted great, the core aspect of the dish was severely lacking - especially compared to the other items ordered at the restaurant. I was able to use hot sauce to mask the flavor of the fish.

Location: (Not a factor in the rating)

Prep & Pastry is a very nice and aesthetic looking restaurant. There are a lot of places to park even if the lot is full and we only waited about 30 min on a Holiday Sunday at noon.

This place is no exception- great customer service and the pastries were fabulous! If you are looking for ordinary- go somewhere else...This place puts flare on ordinary food ...We sat outside and found it to be very pleasant - though if temps were above 100 I wouldn't recommend it...There was a fan but no misters so it could get rather hot...The staff go above and beyond in customer service asking if I would like a coffee to go!,21/8/2015 16:39
278,278,1,5,5,0,4,"With 1200+ reviews, and 4.5 stars it's pretty obvious that PnP is a beloved Tucson spot. I can see why - I loved it too!

The space is small and simple with a generous patio (which wasn't open on our visit because it was ""cold""). Prepare to have a hard time making a food decision as everything on the menu looks great. I opted for biscuits and gravy with eggs and a side of turkey sausage. 

Can we talk about those biscuits? They're huge, like the size of my face huge, and perfectly fluffy and topped with oh-so-good sausage gravy.

Can we talk about my eggs? PERFECTLY cooked. PERFECTLY. 

Can we talk about their housemade sausage? The turkey is a little spicy and the pork version is wonderfully seasoned. If you eat meat and don't order one of these, I am sad for you. 

Finally, can we talk about Matt? If Matt has your table you're going to have a good time because he's pretty great. 

Two thumbs up!",23/1/2018 23:56

Communists, that's who.

We tried stopping here right when we got to Tucson on a Sunday morning which is an amateur move on our parts.....they had an hour wait for two people. But hearing that only validated that we must come back so we hit up Prep and Pastry again on a Tuesday morning right when they opened so we were guaranteed to get a table. Within 15 minutes, some other tables came in an the place was bumping. 

While I would love to be a sweets for breakfast kinda person, I just can't do it, I'm savory road all the way. I ordered the pork belly breakfast sandwich with country hash and it was good. I was expecting to have a mouthgasm but there was too little sriracha sauce and the slaw wasn't too flavorful. But the pork belly was seasoned and cooked to perfection so I can't complain about that. My boo got the biscuits and gravy with cheddar biscuits and it was heavenly, I would get that if I was to ever come back while in Tucson. We got some sweets to go since we couldn't leave without one, the pistachio/mascarpone croissant redeemed P&P for the pork belly sandwich.....it gave me a mouthgasm! Like multiple ones.

-serves specialty/locally roasted coffee from EXO.
-the space is comfortable and welcoming. You could stay there all day. 
-Sunday brunch is worth the wait. 

Negatives:
-the only complaint I have is for the Cronut. It's unfortunately dry and hard if not ordered from the oven. Ask how long it's been out of the oven before you order it, and or ask them to warm it up first. 

Business suggestions:
-you guys are excellent and a true Tucson gem. Keep doing what your doing.

We tried the mango glazed dossant, the original scone, and the raspberry chocolate croissant.  Everything was fan-freaking-tastic, but my hands-down favorite was the dossant.  Have croissant, halt donut, whoever thought this up should be given a medal.  So delicious!  One complaint I do have is I wish they would include the prices next to the pastries.

I finally got down there on Monday this week and I asked the waiter/possible owner(?) to pick something for me. He picked the brioche French toast stuffed with a berry compote and freshly whipped cream. It was decadent, sweet but balanced, and served with real maple syrup. I also ordered a cup of chamomile tea and they brought it out in a personal size French press. So cute! I also got another to go, at no added cost! 

I also loved the interior. It has a farmhouse or old barn feel about it with chalkboard painted walls covered in cute drawings and quotes. The decor makes you feel good, with so much natural light coming in through the many windows in the building.

410,408,1,3,2,1,1,"Sigh.  My kingdom for an experience that doesn't degrade over time like a bad drug habit.

I have gotten burned out with my normal venues and in a frantic mental search for where I hadn't been that was relatively close and might be ok, I remembered Amelia Grey's - I keep passing by at times when it's closed or for some reason can't go, and then I forget about it when I'm going...in any case, I'd been meaning to go, and hadn't.  The Native Cafe used to be a favorite and that location has since had trouble keeping an anchor. 

When I arrived on this weekday morning, it was no longer AG's, but Prep & Pastry.  Therefore, part of the imagery which had drawn me - ie, bakery case and cafe feel - was gone.  Instead, it was a nicely appointed restaurant in the ubiquitous chunks of wood and lofty ceiling all the places in Tucson now must do.  Maybe you can't even get a build-out permit in Tucson if you don't use that aesthetic, it's that pervasive.

The first thing I noticed was that the hostess stand is in the wrong place.  It needs to be further to the left so that a table or two can be put in front of the fire place without congesting the entry.  Now that space looks oddly empty and the flow through is wrong.  The second thing I noticed is that this place is heavy on the young men.  A woman may likely greet you and cook, but most of the servers I've seen are men.  That's interesting and definitely creates a vibe which I'm not sure if I like or don't.  

The first day, I was delighted to see that breakfast in some form can be had in the afternoons.  As we know, breakfast is best had at any time of day and should be always on offer, but rarely is.  I had the simple breakfast, which was indeed simple, but for a restaurant of a certain genre, not badly priced at $6.  Except, you know, they scrimp on the toast...artisan toast.  Eye roll.  My biggest complaints were that the eggs were heavy on the salt, the bread was too hard and the bacon too soft.  The coffee was very good, even if my server was too busy talking football and whatnot to refill it timely.  I did feel that I would be getting better service if I was cuter, which is not what you want.  All in all, though, my experience was good and I was sure to come back.

So, I did.  Sadly, it was a downhill experience.  This time I made sure to come in the hours of a full breakfast menu, only to find that it wasn't appreciably more varied.  I ordered the omelette after the waiter had fawned on its inclusion of steak, 5-yr cheddar, mushrooms, tomatoes.  Yum.  It arrived, again oversalted and without a trace of steak.  My toast also arrived hard and completely dry, with no butter or jam.  Sigh.  Coffee was still good.

But, here's what kinda altered my good feelings.  Hey, you know, they're new and I'm well willing to let some bugs get worked out while everyone is figuring out what works. Tweaking is inevitable. So, when I pointed out the lack of a major ingredient in my dish, I wasn't mad.  Just, you know, fix it.  However, the answer I got was that the waiter had made a mistake and read the ""beefsteak"" tomatoes as steak and tomatoes.  Ok, again, these amusing foibles take place.  And?

And nothing.  Though I would not have ordered the dish as it was and although the waiter was clearly in error, no one seemed to feel that warranted any attention.  Not a comped danish or coffee or jack.  So, what had been a good time by all was now a source of irritation at dumb customer service, which, if I am being frank about my bias, I think may relate to having so many boys in the house.  There's so often just a....lack of social finesse and empathic awareness when boys are in charge (Tony @ MakerHouse is a huge exception to this generality).

It all reminded me of the book, 5 Apology Languages.  I am, most decidedly, in the Accepting Responsibility and Restitution camps.  I am not interested in your flowery debasement, nor is mere acknowledgment enough.  I want to know how you're going to make it right.  Because, otherwise, an apology without making it right just tells me that you're paying lip service and really don't give a shit if I'm happy.  

So, yes, I'll probably go back for limited wants, but it is unlikely to be my go-to.  And guys:  cut it out with the salt, for christ sake.",7/2/2014 21:55

436,434,1,4,3,0,2,"Did my research before my last visit to Tucson and I saw this place had lots of reviews for having opened so recently. Prep & Pastry is kind of how I would want my home to be--warm, modern but not pretentious and totally about the pastries. I sat at the counter. So, I got to enjoy how they have a big window into the kitchen and you can see the pastry chef hard at work. Unfortunately, it's too noisy and too far to talk to her, not that I would want to disrupt her baking alchemy. I love the wooden floating shelves by the window where the have everything from plants to an egg beater.

I ordered the duck confit hash, which was solid. I think for my own preference, it could have used more salt but the duck part was very tender. The other ingredients seemed very fresh. One of the owners, Nate, started chatting with me. He was super-friendly and I think because I was by myself and watched the pastry chef bring out a tray of fresh cronut-knockoffs, he offered me one gratis. So I had the maple-glazed with crumbled, real bacon which was very yummy. I tried to ration it off but I finished the other half that same day despite swearing I'd at least wait til the next morning. The pastry chef is also a really friendly gal. She said she was looking for ideas for other cronut flavors and I just randomly made suggestions. 

This place used to be some kind of tea room so they've kept up the tradition by offering afternoon tea. I don't live in Tucson so next time I come, I will for sure make time to go there and perhaps try the tea.",19/3/2014 5:33
437,435,1,3,0,0,0,"BFF and I had been dying to try this place, and this was our first visit.
Got there at 9:00, just before the rush and were seated on the patio right away by the friendly hostesses (hostii?). Promptly greeted with water and menus. For drinks, a fuzzy navel mimosa and a meinkes mayor - both delicious and a good value at $5 and $6, respectively. For breakfast I ordered the monte cristo, while my friend ordered the sweet potato hash. We were unimpressed with each menu item; both were bland and it seemed everything was undercooked from the potatoes in the country hash to the brioche in the monte cristo.
Consensus: I'll give it another chance, as some other entrees passing by our table looked enviable, and the service is super duper. Look out, A.M. Relleno, you're on my list!",29/6/2014 19:37
440,438,1,5,5,3,6,"Hands down, one of my favorite place to have brunch around town! 

My last visit I had ""The chef omelet with a side of country hash"" - which changes daily.
The mint leaves was a great touch to my delicious omelet.  

My favorite dish would be the ""Biscuits and Gravy"". Cheddar biscuit, sausage, smothered with duck fat gravy and two over easy egg on top. Need I say more?

Of course, you can't come to P&P and not have one of their famous Bloody Mary's! The Bloody Mary is loaded with ingredients: tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, fresh lemon or lime juice, horseradish, black pepper, and celery salt -- each contributing to ""a blend of hundreds of flavor compounds that act on the taste senses"". Well P&P sure knows how to hit all taste senses with their version of ""The Bloody Mary""

The wait staff here is on point, always so friendly and always make sure our glasses are never empty.

The chicken and french toast were ok. Pretty much an entire chicken breast is presented, along with rosemary brioche french toast. The french toast was super doughy - yummy, but really filling.

I must give them a lot of credit for their unique menu, impressive bakery and extensive array of brunch cocktails.  I also loved the rustic venue, with its high ceilings and wood floors.  Our waiter was a delight, he really made our experience a pleasant one.  

My only criticism is the food.  I was told that I have to order the french toast because it's their specialty.  I ending up getting the french toast of the day, which had whipped cream, blueberries, sweet cream cheese and brioche bread.  To begin with, the portion was way too big.  They gave me four huge slices and I'm the type of person who prefers less food, so that I can enjoy my meal without feeling engorged.  The texture of the french toast was too dry, it seems like they didn't soak it in the custard long enough.  There were very few blueberries and the combo of whipped cream and cream cheese was just too rich.  Maybe I ordered the wrong item!

My mom had the a.m. relleno which was the perfect portion size and very tasty, but a little too spicy.  My brother ordered the monte cristo with a side of biscuits and gravy.  Again, the portion was out of control!  Two giant sandwiches that were impossible to eat, with a ton of potatoes.  Altogether, just too heavy.  As for the drinks, my coffee and peach/orange mimosa was delicious, but the red sangria was far too sweet.

To top it off, this place is crazy busy on the weekend.  My family and I got there at 9am, so we only had to wait about 20 minutes.  After 10am, it was a zoo.

I'm probably in the minority here, but I think Prep and Pastry is trying too hard to impress their customers with lots of flavors and huge portions.  They should scale back and simplify.  I know it's brunch and it's supposed to be decadent, but you have to strike a balance.  I think I'll stick with B-line for breakfast.",24/9/2015 22:43

The best found for me is their lady Earl Grey from Maya tea.  As someone soaked in tea all day long, I like to try tea around the world.  Maya Lady Earl Grey is by far the best I've had. It has a touch of floral fragrance and a tint vanilla. The flora aroma is subtle and not overpowering the tea. 

The sweet potato hash is absolutely amazing!

The space heater was on, but it was unnecessary on such a lovely day, so I asked if it could be turned off and the obliging young man did.  The menu is extensive and enticing.  There are several breakfast offerings and several more for lunch.  It was difficult to decide and when I did make a choice I thought wistfully of roads not taken.  Though many things tempted me, I went w/ the grilled cheese sandwich and tomato bisque.  Alan ordered the tri tip slider, a house made cheddar biscuit, scrambled egg, arugula, jalapeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½o jam, served w/ country hash.  He ordered coffee and I ordered Lady Earl Grey tea.

The tea was served in a French press-type device.  We had whole milk on the side for both coffee and tea.  My tea cup was tall, graceful white porcelain.  The contents of the press just filled it.  The tea was very tasty.  When our dishes arrived they looked beautiful.  My sandwich contained tea smoked tomato, pulled mozzarella rubbed bread, mint cashew pesto.  It was luscious and generous enough to share bites w/ Alan and still be too much for me to finish.  The tomato bisque was dark and subtly smokey, w/ occasional chunks of tomato.  It was my childhood comfort food grown up and elegant.  Alan gave me a taste of his biscuit and it was delicious.  He loved the dish, although he found the finely diced potatoes disappointingly bland, lacking onions, peppers or anything else to give them interest.  His expectations may have been raised by the term 'hash'.  We were taken enough w/ our lunches that we discussed returning tomorrow to explore more of the menu  Perhaps we will.

The restaurant wasn't full when we arrived shortly before 11:30, but a steady stream of people arrived in groups of two and larger and soon both indoor and outdoor tables were close to full.

The first thing I noticed was the french toast was a bit burnt, and so was the chicken. I take my first bite, and the rosemary, and french toast was a very interesting taste I've never had, and I liked it. However it still had that faint burnt taste, but still very good. The chicken on the other hand, had NO flavor. I ask my girlfriend how her food was, and I see this look of disappointment. She LOVES eggs Benedict, and she flat out said these were the worst she has ever had. I asked her to let me try it, and the hollandaise had absolutely no flavor, the pork belly was eh, but the asparagus was pretty good, though.

While we waited I started with a prickly pear Margarita. It was delicious and fabulously priced at $7. Getting a drink at the bar was easy and fast despite the crowd. 

When we were seated we decided to do a little sharing with our dishes since we literally wanted to try everything. We started with the maple bacon cronut. I was honestly really disappointed! I love cronuts so much and was really looking forward to this. It would have been much better if it was served warm! It was cold, dry and felt stale! I was not impressed and won't be ordering another one. We ended up also getting the smoked salmon beni, the duck confit hash and the breakfast poutine. Everything was just okay. I definitely liked it, the presentation was great and the dishes were all cooked well I just think they were lacking in flavor. The description of the duck confit hash was so fabulous and I really had high flavor expectations. I felt the dish fell flat and was really missing something.

679,663,1,4,3,1,0,"Upon arriving in Tucson, I was told by a friend that this is the best place for brunch...that's a pretty tall order, but I was not disappointed.

SERVICE: They are notorious for their wait time on weekends as I'm sure other yelpers can attest to, but after enjoying a delicious meal here, I can see why! My group of 7 arrived around 11 and were told there was a 2 hour wait!! WHAT?! The place is rather small. It ended up being a little over an hour since some groups before us didn't want to wait. They do have some outside seating as well, and I recommend sitting at the bar if you're only 2 people. It's probably best to come with a group of max 4 people.

The two owners came by our table to say hello and thank us for coming by  and chat for a bit -- that doesn't happen every day! They were genuine and I could tell that they really put their heart into great service, atmosphere and excellent food. 

DRINKS: The mimosas are a must try! Great way to get your brunch time going and get happy :) I had the fuzzy naval and the other girls tried the blueberry one and Madras (guava).  I couldn't really taste much peach flavor in mine, but peach is a mild flavor anyway. I liked it either way - very tasty! 

FOOD: The menu is small but sufficient to find something interesting. After we ordered, one of the owners brought us a sample of their newest brioche french toast to get our opinion on it (see photo). It's not even on the menu yet!! It was a bit tart and not overly sweet.

The ONLY thing I didn't like about the menu is that since I never eat meat in the mornings, that cut out a lot of the options on the menu, as many items have duck, sausage or ham/pork. I had the omelette, which changes every day by the way. Today it had carrot purre, leeks, spinach, tomato slices and cheese, with springs of sprouts on top. It came with hashbrowns on the side. When I first saw the plate I thought it was very small, but it fills you up.  Everyone was speechless when the food arrived -- that's when you know the food is gooood :) Overall the meals were fairly healthy and satisfying for everyone. 

Delicious, I will be back! I'd like to try them out for lunch too.",9/3/2015 0:05

I continually pay for food that is over priced and is just a whisper of what it could be.  The Duck hash was perfect. A little crispy and smooth to the bite.

709,561,1,3,0,0,0,I guess this is a case where I just don't get it. The restaurant is wildly popular but I think it's just average. I've been there 3 times. The first time I had the chili relleno which was simply scrambled eggs in an uncooked green pepper with a few tortilla strips on it. The waiter highly recommended the hash browns which came cold and slightly greasy. The next time I had the bacon donut which was tasty but rather tough and a little dry. The third time I had a confection of mascarpone on top of a croissant. But the crossaint wasn't flaky it was tough and the mascarpone didn't quite go. Service was good but the coffee was always lukewarm. So I guess this is a case of more style over substance.,30/1/2017 23:38

714,696,1,4,2,2,2,"I've heard tons of good things about Prep & Pastry, so when my fiance and I drove by last Sunday morning, I suggested we stop for brunch.

When we walked in, the hostess said it would be about a 45 minute wait, but she wasn't sure since some people had left without telling her. Looking around the restaurant, there were quiet a few empty tables, and there didn't seem to be too many people waiting, so I was slightly confused. But since we weren't in a rush or grungry (the anger of being overly hungry), we decided to wait.

Luckily, we had only been sitting outside for about 15 minutes when our name was called. The interior is super cute! I really liked the high ceilings and how bright the restaurant was. It was definitely the perfect atmosphere for a lazy Sunday brunch.

After much deliberation, we finally made our decisions and ordered.  I ordered the breakfast poutine and my fiance had the chx + toast (fried chicken strips, rosemary brioche french toast, and a blueberry syrup). My poutine was just okay. It was a solid portion, but kind of bland, and I definitely didn't see any cheese curds. On the other hand, my fiance loved his dish! I thought the different components sounded weird on paper, but once I had a bite, I was sold! The chicken was flavorful, and the rosemary french toast was the perfect savory accompaniment, but I do wish it was a little less soggy. However, I did think the chicken was on the dry side.

Although we didn't have room to sample their pastries, they all looked amazing. I will definitely be trying one on my next visit.

I think overall, I would give Prep & Pastry 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding it up to 4 since I think I would be happier if I got a different dish next time. Also, I don't think the wait would be so bad on most weekends, but the Sunday we went was super windy, so I don't think many people wanted to sit outside.",18/3/2014 22:33

Waiters have to be on their toes to keep up but  are friendly and prompt. It's like a younger, more hip version of Blue Willow. Atmosphere is upbeat, casual, busy.

Interesting dishes and pastries and a liberal use of Duck and gravy in the menu. The strawberry preserves are ethereal  but only 1 slice of bread for side order of toast. The chicken and Toast was great as was the omelette . The pouting was too much.  The thing that brought down the score was the 2 pieces of bacon for a side dish.

I had previously left a 5 star review exclaiming my love, but now after all the hype has died, I now feel the need to be honest. I could have totally gone on an off day today, but I feel a need to state my experience and my previous experiences that I've been ignoring.
Service was still tremendous as always, never a complaint there. They checked up regularly, which is always welcomed.
Atmosphere is always the lovely hipster, warm, country feel. Welcomed as well.
The food however, is where I've just got to be honest. I'm forever in love with their poutine which I found they only serve on weekends, so I was totally bummed today. Instead, I ordered The Bacon Lucy. While a great idea, I found the bun to be too dense. It had wonderful crisp edges, but was way too thick to enjoy a burger. The taste was okay. A little on the salty side, wouldn't recommend it to someone who has to watch their BP. Also, it kept falling apart and was hard to handle. The fries that accompanied were okay, limp, meh.
My husband ordered The Dip. We tried this the very first time we visited which was only a week or two after opening. We complained it was way too salty to eat and we were compted and given a free pastry. The situation was handled lovely. But unfortunately it was still salty and we won't be ordering it again. My husband still ate it all though because he was too hungry to complain. Plus, they really skimped on the meat. The first time we had it, it was full of meat and cheese but now it was pretty much all bread again like my burger and what meat was in there was salty as well as the au jus. I'm particular about my au jus and this is way too salty to dip in.
I ordered a mimosa for the first time today. A fuzzy navel. Our waiter fixed it and unfortunately did not know how to mix a mimosa. It was 98% champagne and barely any OJ and peach flavor. They threw in a little orange peel in the champagne too... Nice touch I guess.
To go we ordered our favorite maple bacon cronuts which have always blown us away and we were left with solid cronuts. No fluff, no flake, equivalent to a stress ball. We were totally sad.
I'm just really sad about my visit and we will continue to visit but with stretches of time in between.
One thing I want to comment on as well is that, I know that perfection takes time, but with the food we got and how long we waited, they really need to step that up. It wasn't even packed today and we still waited some good time. In the past, they've always given us free pastries for waiting so long (30-40min). No complaint there, lovely service like I've said. I will always wait for my poutine too, but ""prep"" still needs improvement.
I guess I'll have to settle for the super packed weekends and wait to have my delicious poutine.

The drinks are epic. I wanted the sampler flight of all the choices. We did Bloody Mary & Honeymoon. Two very good choices. BM was one of the best & HM was a perfect refreshing choice for brunch (old fashion w/ a twist) 
Chicken & toast was my husbands choice. Very good with a great spicy kick. The chicken was cooked perfect & the sweet blueberry french toast was the perfect match. My daughter ate the Sammie & it was fantastic. The right balance of ingredients with a hefty slice of bacon. I got the biscuit & duck fat  gravy. Seriously filling but worth every bite!!

My table mates had the pork-belly-beni, it was served cold and nasty, and the other had the sweet potato hash, it was flavorless and greasy. On our second trip, the restaurant was very crowded so we sat outside again. Once again, we were swarmed by flies! They turned on the 'mist' which was basically a water gun, soaking us while we sat. This time I tried the monte cristo, the French toast was flavorless and the cheese tasted rotten. My table mates had the pork belly breakfast sandwich, the pork was cut so thick that it was hard to chew. My other table mate tried the home-made ""cronuts"", sad to say that if I closed my eyes, I would've mistook them for Dunkin donuts.

Let's just say I can't wait to go back and test it out! 

The ambiance of the restaurant is quite comforting. The decor is quite cute and homie. The service also added a lot to our experience. Rose took care of us and was more than sweet and helpful! She took the time to ensure a great first experience.

FOOD:  4 stars.  So many choices--all made there and INTERESTING.  I had their version of the French Dip--and it was amazing.  My wife had their hash and she loved it as well.  We wanted to order pretty much everything on the menu because it all sounded so good--it would be great if they had a small tasting menu or tapas plates that would let you try all of their amazing food!

I've never had a pork belly benedict and after trying theirs, I would highly recommend it!  I did not order any pastries or mimosas, but intend to the next time I come in.  They have cronuts!!! Having that said, there were a couple of things that bothered me, but not to the point of where I wouldn't return.  The servers were mainly men.  And when young women came through the doors, their interest for them was blatant. One server almost knocked over some water glasses because he couldn't keep his eyes off.  Sort of unprofessional, but comical at the same time.  That didn't affect how my service was.  Our server was awesome!

The perks of Prep and Pastry is the service and atmosphere. The place looks like something out of Pintrest and staff that are incredibly friendly and attentive. What lacks is the actual food. The tri-tip was somehow uninspired, relying heavily on the small amount of BBQ sauce they put on it. The biscuit overpowered the insides of it. The potatoes looked and tasted like they came from a freezer bag. The coffee was good and pastry selection and taste was more advanced than most of the bakeries around Tucson. 

Overall, come here for the experience and feel, but don't get your hopes up on eating anything mind blowing, for which it is priced reasonably.",24/1/2015 18:00
849,817,1,4,3,3,5,"Come here for brunch and leave your diet plans at the door! 
I think this place is all about brunch. It does get crowded, so be prepared, but brunch means you'll get to try their ""Monte Cristo"" and ""Chicken and Toast."" And you won't feel like restraining your mimosa intake. The weekly breakfast menu is smaller; although, the pastries just might make up for the lack of diversity since the cronuts and scones are top notch.
One menu misstep in my opinion is the ""Veggi Beni,"" and the ""A.M. Relleno"" could use some tweaking. I thought the texture of the ""Veggi Beni"" was all wrong. The egg, hollandaise, and vegetables made for a slippery mess. The ""A.M. Relleno"" needed more mole sauce and spice (I couldn't taste much of that poblano), and could have been kicked up with some protein, maybe steak. 
On a recent visit, the friendly bartender mentioned that they wanted to create a boutique vibe, and when I thought about it, I did kind of feel like I was in eating in a small, organic beauty store-turned-restaurant. But the crafty decor is appropriate for the crafty menu, which I don't have too many complaints about.",17/11/2014 17:38

There was a mistake made on the order (those things happen)  and the manager came over immediately and apologized, took responsibility for the error, and of course, took the meal off of the bill.

The wait  was 45 minutes at 10am on a weekend, which is totally understandable. Once walking in the atmosphere was really pleasant -- almost like warm country barn. The waitress was friendly also.
But the food... boy was I disappointed. 
I ordered the biscuits and gravy, and I was expecting some flavor, or some large portion size, or some uniqueness for costing over $10... But I got nothing. Medium to small portion, bland gravy, and boring biscuits.
The girlfriend was also disappointed in her french toast. She claimed it was boring.

Considering the price, reviews, and wait I was pretty let down by this place. They have the atmosphere and friendliness down, just need to work on the food. I probably won't return with all the other breakfast places left to check out in the area.",1/7/2014 12:50

tried a variety of their dishes & drinks over a few visits!
---grilled cheese w/ tomato soup: YUM, the grilled cheese had a burst of flavor.. the bread coulda been toastier BUT i can overlook that because it was served w/ THE BEST TOMATO SOUP I'VE EVER HAD and i usu don't like tomato soup
---meatloaf sandwich: DELISH.. didn't see this on the breakfast menu so it must be a lunch option
---tri tip sliders w/ hash: liked the cornbread bun, the hash was crispy & tasty, tri tip itself was okay
---chicken & toast: chicken crust was very flavorful w/ a spicy kick
---sweet potato hash: MMm loving the poached egg on top
---dossants: variety of rotating flavors to choose from. i've had the strawberry & honey lavender.. flavors are good but i feel like the dossants are not that flaky.. i prefer their scones

need an alcoholic concoction? mimosas are only $5!
---madras: MY FAVORITE, can't go wrong w/ guava
---cosmo: my 2nd favorite, but madras wins by a landslide
---the cure: this blueberry drink was a bit sweet for me
---greyhound: just ok
---white sangria: also a good drink!

I always substitute the side of potatoes for a side of the sweet potato hash, which is also one of the best things I've ever eaten. I've also tried the oven roasted sweet potato hash as a main dish, which is also good. The French toasts are a bit bland in my opinion, though. 

My only other complaint is that there is usually a very long wait on the weekends and I don't think you can make reservations. Besides that the restaurant is cute and has a great atmosphere.

895,866,1,4,2,0,3,"Ever since I saw the first reviews of this sweet little place start popping up on Yelp, it's been high on my list of places to try. Then Amanda D. mentioned she was organizing a UYE brunch last Saturday and, of course, I was in! 

On a gorgeous sunny morning on the patio, our group sampled two kinds of doughssants and were privileged to preview a new chocolate chip version of the brioche French toast while we waited for our breakfast orders. My very first doughssants (so much nicer sounding than ""cronuts"") were sweet, light and melt-on-the-tastebuds delicious. I bought a couple to go on my way out. (But at $4 a pop, I think I'll be able to keep from developing too much of an obsession.) 

For me, the brioche French toast was a tad too soft and doughy. But the sweet potato hash? Perfection! Diced sweet potato, bell pepper, shallots, asparagus, and corn topped with an over easy egg and dollop of herbed mousse. 

The owners made a study of the nation's top breakfast places, visiting, dining and combining the best of those legends with their own family recipes to create a fresh, very eclectic menu. Prep & Pasty is the total package - from the rustic interior and roomy patio to the heavenly smells from the bakery to the buzz of good energy all around. 

On my ""to try"" list for lunch: the much praised Grilled Cheese sandwich (arugula & pistachio pesto, tea smoked tomato, pulled mozzarella, camembert, parmesan rubbed bread, served with tomato bisque) and the Big Brother Beets salad (roasted beets, greens, fennel, cider vin, hazelnuts, apple, goat cheese croutons).

My favorite menu item to get is the Monte Cristo. It's delicious and has made me fall in love with Monte Cristos. I get excited when I see them on other menus but they really aren't as good elsewhere. Their mimosas are also top notch!

Last visit was for Brunch with two friends for my birthday (what better way to start a birthday, right?). The wait is usually long especially for Saturday and Sunday brunch but this time we got to sit at the bar so big relief. The staff is always kind and as attentive as they can be considering how busy they can get.

Onto the food, every time I come here I have a bit of a crisis because everything looks so good and I cannot make up my mind. I have enjoyed everything I've gotten and hope to try so much more; there grilled cheese is flavorful, delicious and comes with a tomato bisque that will impress you, the poutine is hearty and tasty (duck gravy; the real deal), the tri-tip sliders are tender and are served on delicious, crumbly biscuits. My favorites have to be the Monte Cristo and the s'mores French Toast; they really know how to serve up a good french toast. Overall the food is creative, flavorful but not overwhelming (was worried the s'mores would be too sweet but got through it without a problem) and has some subtleties to it. The same can be said for the drinks, I'm not a big mimosa fan but they have some great concoctions here.

Let's not forget the pastries; the star is the dossant (croissant dough prepared like a doughnut) whose flavors follow the theme of creativity and taste; maple bacon, fruit punch, and espresso to name a few. Also, I got a free dossant for my birthday so I have to be happy.

920,888,1,4,4,6,0,"So after weeks of anticipation, I finally got around to picking up a doughsant. They sit in the window behind the bar looking so perfect and delicious, drawing you in, like Sirens. I picked the maple bacon doughsant, took it home, stared at it, took some pictures, and then took a bite...

Well the Sirens' song ends in death for those sailors foolish enough to give into their voice and beauty. After tasting P&Ps doughsant, I wish I could get the time I spent daydreaming about them back...not to mention my $4. I'm still alive, but a wee part of me has died. 

Nothing was right about this pastry. And yes, I know, the experience was maybe partially tainted by my high expectations.Let me explain:
1) The cronut (from NYC) was dreamed up when its creators thought to combine the airy, flaky croissant and chewy, sweet, fried doughnut to make a product far tastier than the sum of its parts. The doughsant is not as good as a doughnut and definitely not as good as a croissant. 
2) It's really hefty and dense. If you threw it at someone's face, it would really hurt. Not texturally pleasing at all. 
3) The icing is grainy. Neither smooth nor creamy.
4) The dough, without the icing, had no flavor at all, except the flavor listed in number 5.
5) The one distinct flavor in the dough was bitterness. The bitterness of over-risen bread. The bitterness of alcohol. The bitterness of starved yeast cells forced to undergo alcoholic fermentation. I couldn't taste it over the sweet frosting, but when tasting the base on its own, it was super apparent and hard to forget.

That's probably enough of a review about one doughnut.  I still think it's a 4 star place (previously 5, but minus a star for the awful doughsant). The other food and drinks are good and I previously had a great experience. 

Definitely a place to try. But, if the doughsants are calling your name from the window where they perch, pleasssssseee, plug your ears, cover your eyes, and walk on.",13/10/2015 23:56

However, it's well worth the wait if you have the time! Before I even start on the food, I'll say that the atmosphere of the restaurant itself is cheerful and welcoming. The breakfast-related quotes on the walls inside are so fun, and my friends and I were able to sit outside on the covered patio which was great on a warm Saturday in Arizona.

My personal favorite plate is their biscuits and gravy; their biscuits have seasonings in them which make them really unique and delicious! The hash browns have peppers and onions mixed in and are perfectly cooked, so I have to order them on the side even when my meal doesn't come with them. If you're in the mood for something sweet, their french toast is incredible - I tried the apple streusel - and you can get a half order if you want to sample more than one type of french toast, which I had never seen before and was great since I don't typically like to eat so much sugar for breakfast. 

Their dossants are amazing if you're interested in dessert. I kept seeing them pass our table while we were chatting so I ordered a strawberry one and was not disappointed.

The manager informed us that that is how the chicken is supposed to look because this chicken doesn't have hormones... ?

Let's get the bad out of the way first -  I  dock a star for their doughsant (cronut).  The first time I had it, it was soft, flaky amazing.  As others have mentioned, it is now rock hard and takes effort to cut.  They are cooking them too long and they are getting a dark hard outter shell.  I am hopefuly the owners take note and get back to the original  they served.  Don't let your success ruin you by overproducing and skipping the quality control!  Side note, the cheese filled croissant is delightful. 

Drinks - They get the star back I took away for the pastry.  Having their liquor license makes everything better.  I tried the greyhound mimosa and loved it.  I also love their ice tea.  So good.

Food- I have been fortunate to try several dishes.  The sweet potato hash is an absolute favorite.  (Not sure why people are whining that it is not really ""hash"", get over it).  It is amazing and good.  Eat it and like it.   Sheesh.  I also tried pork belly breakfast sandwich.  The egg was perfect and I loved the pork belly.  The tri-tip sliders were good but need some work.  One of my cheddar biscuits was falling apart.  Had to eat that slider with a fork.  I did taste the jam, but it needs more of it because it is sooo good.  The biscuits and gravy, another great dish.  I thought gravy was super flavorful and unlike a lot of places, the biscuits were not dried out.  

Overall I love this place.  But they need to be careful that growth and success do not give way to quality.  The doughsant is slipping.

The fresh squeezed OJ was so refreshing, I could have had 4 glasses of it.  And the ""dosont"" was to die for!

We arrived around 9am in the middle of a work week, so it wasn't terribly busy.  Our server was polite and took our orders right away.  My husband ordered the prime rib omelet with creamy horseradish sauce, and I had the egg stuffed poblano pepper.  Both meals were good, but they came to the table just a little bit cold.  The poblano dish could have used some more spice, and definitely more salt.  The prime rib omelet was good, but neither of us could taste any of the promised horseradish sauce.  

And because we both have very healthy appetites, we split an order of the special of the day...carrot cake french toast.  This was the best french toast I have ever had!  Not too sweet, delicious all the way around.  It more than made up for our slight disappointment at our meals.

Seems like something P&P could pull off pretty easily, and would certainly do a much better job of it than the weird spinach heap that Blue Willow calls a tofu scramble.

1027,988,1,2,3,0,0,"I went twice, May 21 & 22.  This is the average star rating between those days.  Allow me to explain.

The Bloody Mary: delicious. Never considered adding coffee stout as a thing to my breakfast drink of choice but it definitely help cut the spice but in a good way to make it more savory. 

The duck confit with egg: well made, good. The duck was great.  The goat cheese cherry mixture was perfect.  The flavors... none over powered the other. 

Maple bacon donut: delicious breakfast appetizer, perfect to share...well baked.  The frosting is perfect = not too sweet so you can actually taste the bacon.

Now...to the less desired.

The chicken and toast: the fried chicken was very, very dry. The toast was a nice idea turned up with blueberry.  But I think toast plus dried chicken are a poor match...I'm not sure how fried chicken could be dry.

Salmon beni: no. Just don't get this.  The combination of salted cooked smoked salmon and very rich buttery hollandaise sauce.  The egg lacked the rich yolk to off set the saltiness, with a giant piece of bread underneath it.  It's just too much...tone it all down. 

Egg in the basket: the egg lacked a rich yolk. Because of the lack of yolk, the well cooked tomatoes and Brussel sprouts didn't have any flavor.  The bread was cold, maybe made well before the egg.  

I think this place has potential... But where ever they buy their eggs from needs to be turnt up.  Cut the richness in already heavy dishes, increase the savoriness.  If you wait almost an hour for breakfast, you are expecting an off the chain meal for champions.  I left with either an extraordinary yearning for water or peptobismal.

1094,1051,1,4,0,0,0,"Prep & Pastry is my addiction. Frankly, I search through my friends to see who hasn't eaten here and I immediately invite myself along for their first visit, just so I have a reason to go.

The infamously long wait time is a huge downside of course, but since I've always had great past experiences with the service and food, I bide my time by getting either a mimosa or bloody mary to sip on while I wait. Speaking of which, P&P's bloody mary is one of the best I've come across. They include a sample taster of pickle, bacon and cheese, a 1055 sweet stout beer back (which is, in itself, so delicious) and the rim of the glass is coated with a spicy seasoning. It's like an appetizer and a drink all in one. The only thing I would change is the hunk of cheese, it's a bit flavorless. 

I always try to switch up my orders so that I can get through their menu, but because I have found such great items, it's hard to stray away. The Beni is always a go-to classic option. Their Breakfast Poutine is such a filling indulgence and their Monte Cristo is a great balance of sweet and savory. 

I'm pleased to say that their service is fairly good. Almost every time I've visited, the manager has come to my table to check on how things are going; it's just a nice touch. Since they are so busy on the weekends, the attentiveness of the servers are so-so, but it's understandable what with the insane rush. 

P&P always has freshly baked pastries (as the restaurant name would indicate). Their maple bacon doussant is absolutely ridiculous. If you don't have a sweet tooth, you might want to keep your distance. 

All in all, this place is fantastic. I think the prices are fair and if it's your first time, definitely try to visit during the week versus the weekend. 

Extra side-note: (I do wish they would have a call-ahead option for larger groups though)",11/6/2015 19:29
1097,1054,1,4,1,0,0,"Prep & Pastry mixes rustic decor, fun chalk art, and a modern menu to create a great breakfast experience. I had been wanting to try it for a while, but this isn't my side of town and I'm rarely in the area with time for breakfast. That all changed on Friday, when I had an early appointment in the area and decided to finally make the trip.

Some of the walls were lettered in chalk, and the photos I've seen on Yelp suggest this text changes periodically. I sat beneath a sign that said ""Brunch without alcohol is just a sad, late breakfast."" It made me laugh, and then cry, as I wasn't in a position to drink any alcohol. Ok, I didn't really cry. It was still a funny wall.

Several items on the menu jumped right out at me, and I ordered the french toast Monte Cristo sandwich because I figured, how can that not be awesome? While I waited for my food, I enjoyed the building's atmosphere, as well as the antics of the other patrons. One woman sent back pancakes because they were lightly dusted with powdered sugar. She said she didn't like to feed her son ""added sugar"", even though the waiter explained they also add sugar to the pancake batter (like you do). I wanted to laugh, but they were sitting too close.

When my food arrived, the waiter asked if I wanted ketchup or hot sauce for my potato hash. I answered ""yes"" because I don't usually like chunks of potatoes very much on their own, but actually these were some of the best I've ever had, and needed nothing. The waiter brought me two metal cups with the condiments, which made them look fancy. But the hot sauce was definitely a name brand from a bottle, and I would rather have seen the bottle. The condiment cups seem to imply the sauce is made in-house, but the flavor was very recognizable. I didn't taste the ketchup, but it looked like it was probably the same.

The Monte Cristo itself was sadly mediocre. I suppose I had probably set my expectations too high based on the really amazing Yelp reviews and Prep & Pastry's position near the top of the ""Best of Yelp: Tucson"" list. The sandwich wasn't bad, per se. I thought it had way too much bread and way too little ham, though. Neither the ham nor the cheese had much flavor against the thick slices of bread. The menu mentions pineapple in this dish; I didn't notice that anywhere. It did come with something labeled a ""house marmalade"" which was a small condiment cup of fruit which was also low on flavor. The sandwich was also lightly dusted with added sugar, which looked quite nice.

For me, the atmosphere and presentation was better than the food -- except the potato hash, which was actively excellent. I would probably rate the whole experience a 3.5, and I chose to give them the benefit of the doubt and round that up, rather than down.

The big windows, bright decor, and fireplace (although not lit...it was 80 degrees outside) give the space a comfortable feel that makes you want to stay all day. I stopped by for the soft opening and ordered the Mango Black Tea while I waited for my friends to arrive. The teas are loose leaf and you are given a mini french press which adds to the cottage-y feel of the space. While I sipped my tea, I was given a sample of the blueberry scone which I was eyeing in the pastry case from my seat at the bar. It was very tasty. I also tried a Cronut, which is a hybrid croissant-donut masterpiece. Prep & Pastry is the only place in Tucson that carries them, and they top theirs with a maple glaze and bacon bits. It's delicious. For my meal I ordered the grilled cheese & tomato bisque. I was so hungry I inhaled one half of grilled cheese in less than 2 minutes,but I took my time with the second half to enjoy the pistachio pesto, parmesan crusted bread, tomatoes and brie cheese.

Check In: By 1:30 all but one cronut flavor was gone but the blackberry lemon was amazing enough to bring me back for another popular flavor like the maple bacon. Thankfully, we used the ability to sign up on the waitlist and although we still had a 15 minute wait it was WELL worth it. 

Drinks: I am a huge drink hoarder when eating out. I ordered a coffee, water and a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary came with a lovely little trio of ham, pickle and cheese as well as a side car of a coffee porter. I am not a fan of coffee porters but this one I could have drank all day. The Bloody Mary was perfectly spiced and the rim spices brought a nice kick to the drink. The coffee was also great, and I appreciated the choices of sugars (organic white, in the raw sugar and the typical sweetener packets). 

Food: I ordered the quiche, which is only available in limited quantities because it's made that day, and potatoes. My two friends ordered the biscuits and gravy, and the standard breakfast with a side of bacon. 
 My quiche was INCREDIBLE, the BEST I have ever had in my entire life. The eggs were like clouds in your mouth and the goat cheese was enough to be an enhancement and not overpowering in any manner. The potatoes were like thanksgiving in your mouth, and had a thanksgiving stuffing-like seasoning with the most perfect level of salt. We tried to even find granules of salt and it was simply baked into the potatoes with perfection. My friend also let me try his bacon and it was given a perfect level of candied coating that was to die for. 

Staff: The staff was GREAT. I wish I could remember our waiters name to give him credit (he had a slight beard, tall and wore a hat). He gave us perfect recommendations and was very prompt to our table with drinks. 

Overall: TOP NOTCH and by far the best American breakfast establishment I have been to in Tucson. I plan to return to try, what looked like, an incredible grilled cheese and tomato bisque plate.",9/12/2017 22:16

I had a tomato-spinach omelette with home fries. It wasn't bad, but seemed expensive for what I got. Both the potatoes and the omelette were heavily flavored with rosemary. There's tons of signage trying to peddle mimosas, along the lines of  ""come on, it's OK to drink alcohol early in the day!"" which I found in poor taste.

We were greeted by the hostess who told us it would be a 45 minute wait (I don't know if this is normal or because it was Father's Day), but said she would call us as soon as something opened. We decided, in the meantime, to go next door to the antique shop and mosey around. After about 15-20 minutes, we were seated which was awesome. Our waitress was at our table within moments and she answered any questions we had about the menu. We ordered a Bloody Mary, Classic Mimosa, French Toast, and Chicken & Toast. The Bloody Mary was so good, I ordered a second one by the time the food came out. All in all, this is the best brunch experience that I have had since leaving New York two years ago.

Yes, this place is actually really well sorted.  I was concerned that the offerings would be overpriced, and portions too small, but I was happily mistaken.  Portions were right, well prepared, and the price justified it.  The Spicy Bloody Mary is fantastic, and their doughnuts are super good.

Like a modern day industrial farmhouse. The service was extremely friendly but due to how busy they get, simple tasks were becoming overwhelming. The menu items are an attempt of innovation but the ultimate final results were a slight disappointment. We started with drinks which were ok. My drink didn't really seem to have much alcohol in it (mount something) husbands Bloody Mary was very THICKLY SEASONED. More like a gazpacho. The idea of pork belly on a eggs Benedict sounded amazing. However it was not. I felt like the dish was lacking that eggs beni flavor you look for. The hollandaise was nice and the house made biscuit was very flaky ( flaky could be good and bad only because this implies the biscuit dough wasn't over worked but it also seemed like these biscuits had been sitting out and dried up) I was sad to see the limited amount of sweet items compared to the savory. It was also interesting that they don't really advertise their pastry items. If I hadn't came here after looking at the reviews I would've never known to ask for pastries. Hubby ordered the monte cristo and it was a nice healthier alternative to the typical deep fried version. That too wasn't anything grand. They were very nice to offer the remaining guest a free coffee cream donut because it was near closing time and they don't sell the pastries the next day (A+ for freshness). However THIS TOO wasn't anything special. I was expecting a little more cream filling and the filling to be sweeter BUT I suppose the idea was a donut that resembles a cup of coffee. Overall, would I go back? Probably not on my own but if a group of friends asked me to join them for brunch. It's not bad but it's not crave worthy.",8/4/2018 18:24

We had the chefs omelette (changing selection ) with bacon and cheddar and potato hash. incredibly well seasoned and executed though we felt the omelette could have had just a bit more cheese to bind the bacon with the egg. The potato hash is outstanding. 

Also had the BLT (porky belly, arugula, tomato, with herb mayo spread, on brioche) with fries. fries were well portioned and well seasoned with just a hint of rosemary. the porky belly, which was perfectly crisped and not too fatty, was highlighted by the peppery arugula and herbed mayo.  This sandwich goes into my top 3 favorites of all time! One thought we had was to include choice of side salad or fries and raise the price a bit rather than up charge from chips?

1213,1159,1,4,1,0,0,"I'm writing this review as a combined experience from the few times we went (the first go-around wasn't so great, but the others were much improved).

We'll start with the lesson we learned the first time: Don't go to Prep & Pastry late in the day. They will be out of everything. Seriously, I had to order four different things before I found a menu item that was still available. It was a pretty huge bummer. (I guess it does mean they rely on fresh ingredients and hold their offerings to a high standard -- but, unfortunately, someone in the kitchen didn't get the stocking for that day quite right.) Sadly what I eventually decided on wasn't very impressive -- a tri-tip sandwich.

The subsequent times we went were so much better than the first. Maybe it's because we went at the intended time (brunch), or maybe it's because Prep & Pastry worked out some of the initial kinks. Either way, I'm glad we gave this place another chance.

I had the sweet potato hash, which -- despite being meatless -- was downright awesome. My husband went for the tri-tip sliders, which were a marked improvement from the version I had had our first trip. The larger version's cheddar biscuit became mush in the middle with all of the ""wet"" ingredients, but the smaller slider versions stayed in a much more appetizing state.

We've always had super friendly and accommodating wait staff each time we went.

Oh, and let me take some time to gush about the crounu... erm... doughssant. We've all heard about these trendy pastries becoming the latest craze -- with lines around city blocks in places like New York. ** Believe the hype, people. ** These little (likely 2,000 calorie) pastries are incredible.

I had the green chili French toast. It sounds strange but loved the sweet and spicy combo. It wasn't too sweet (not a fan of sweet stuff) but just sweet enough to cut the spice. My sister had the super healthy sweet potato hash. She talked about it for two days afterwards!  She had energy all day and felt so great!  Husband had a monte cristo and didn't say a word while eating every single bite. 

A word about the atmosphere- it's excessively 'family-friendly'. We were there early on a Sunday. We beat the wait but endured a lot of babies and noisy families by the time we were finishing our meal. No biggy - but something to consider if you're looking for a chill breakfast.

The only reason I feel that I can't is that I've always had to wait 30 minutes to an hour before being seated during brunch hours. Also parking is usually limited and we tend to end up parallel parking on the steeet. Maybe that's a testament to their popularity, which they certainly deserve!

I usually order a mimosa while waiting. Very strong and delicious. Kind of expensive at $7 but they don't water their drinks down.

When we order food it comes out very quickly. The servers and friendly and eager to explain the menu if you ever have questions. I'm a big fan of the simple breakfast which is toast served with chunky strawberry jam and eggs.  I also get a side of bacon, which is the best menu item in my opinion. Very thick, crispy, slightly sweet and savory. My fiancee always orders the Monte Cristo with extra jam. It's a weird combination (ham, pineapple mascarpone, strawberry jam, cheese) but the ingredients come together surprisingly well.

The best thing is that the meals are dirt cheap, especially considering the quality of food and excellent table service. We pay about $20 for two people and are stuffed out of our minds.

I will definitely absolutely be back.",30/10/2017 17:25

1261,74,1,4,1,0,0,"This place is amazing and definitely worth the hype. The food and drinks are always spectacular here. I must say I prefer the atmosphere and the service of the Grant location. Not to say Campbell has bad service, but I've visited both locations a number of times and I've had a couple lackluster service experiences here and have always had amazing servers at Grant. Campbell also seems smaller and packed in. It's difficult finding a place to wait where you're out of the way. The one bad thing is the place is so popular, and they don't take reservations, so expect to wait up to an hour if you're trying to go at prime brunch time on a Saturday or Sunday. 

I've tried several dishes. The breakfast poutine is phenomenal, but they only serve it on weekends. All the dishes are pretty good, really. The grilled cheese and tomato bisque is an excellent lunch choice. Once, I wanted something a little more budget-friendly and went with the simple breakfast with over-medium eggs. The eggs just on their own are really good; I don't know where they get them. And their potatoes and bacon are divine. You really can't go wrong.

The coffee is good. The mimosas are great. If you are going to order a couple of drinks, I suggest ordering the build-your-own mimosas. It will save you a couple bucks. And the pastries are just plain to-die-for, but don't wait to order them; they often run out.",30/9/2017 4:01
1262,1206,1,2,0,0,0,"I ordered biscuits and gravy with two eggs over medium.  The eggs were cooked over easy.  I strongly prefer not to have runny whites which is why I order as I do.  Even Denny's seems to understand what over medium means.  I almost sent the dish back but I can handle a limited amount of runny whites.

The sausage gravy was heavy on the sage, giving it a very flowery taste.  This would be offset by the meat flavor but I don't think the sausage was browned properly so no carmelization to offset the sage.

The whole dish was underseasoned.  Actually I don't think they used any salt at all.  I believe restaurants should serve food properly seasoned unless the patron requests salt-free or something.   It also needed some black pepper but all that was on the table was flavorless pre-ground (just about powdered) pepper.   Really, if you don't want to use pepper in the kitchen, at least provide the customers with grinders with fresh pepper.

The place is obviously popular based on the reviews and the groups of people waiting outside as we left (we were early enough to be seated right away.  The building was nice, clean and comfortable.   Our table did tend to rock a bit - no points off there as few places seem to pay attention to this detail.  Service was good.

From beginning to end, our lunch was fantastic.  Between the three of us, we ordered the dip sandwich, the pork belly bahn mi, and the cuban.  All were beyond tasty, though my favorite was the bahn mi.  If I had one complaint, it's that I wish the menus were a little more informative about some things.  For example, we didn't know that the sandwiches came with fries (it doesn't say so anywhere on the menu), untill we tried to order some on the side and the waitress told us.

I will fully admit that I have a big sweet tooth.  Upon walking it, I was taken with how very busy they were!  It was a packed house.  There was definitely a wait, with not an open seat in the house or patio (or at the bar).  I got in line at the pastry counter and was tempted by many of the lovely treats but ordered The Doughssant with maple glaze and candied bacon.  IT was the yummiest sweet treat I have had in quite some time!  I wish I would've ordered two!

-No wait on a Friday morning at 8:30, we were seated right away. 
-Cool atmosphere
-Food was tasty and they allowed substitutions for cheese and gave us salsa at no extra charge. Love the potatoes!

Cons:
-No air conditioning? It's 100 degrees outside and they only had overhead fans running, we were all sweating
-A little pricey for what you get
-Water was from the tap and tasted very odd

Overall, I was a little disappointed. I've lived in Tucson for a couple of years and have wanted to try this restaurant as it had such good reviews on Yelp and by word-of-mouth. The food wasn't overwhelming and I've had better omelettes for less expensive at other restaurants around town. I don't eat meat but maybe those options are tastier.

Had breakfast here this morning and everything was wonderful.  It started with the friendly greeting by the hostess and continued through paying the check.  We started with a Bloody Mary for him and, at the server's recommendation, a blueberry mimosa for me.  Both were so good and he loved the garnishes so much, the server brought him another one.  While she was getting our drinks, a nice young man walked by and asked if we needed anything.  We told him we were just waiting for drinks and he offered to take our food order if we were ready.  The food was delicious, pork belly eggs benedict and a duck confit pan. Both plates were almost licked clean.  Everyone who came to the table, including just to remove extra dishes, was so welcoming.  It really seemed like they were all part owners instead of employees.

Although we were told P&P doesn't take reservations, one member in my party did manage to prearrange seating for our party of 12. When I arrived 10 minutes before our reserved time, the table wasn't quite ready and the hostess wanted to wait until our full group arrived before seating any of us. My friends trickled in and when we began to take over the entry, she finally began to seat us.

Our server, William was very friendly and knowledgeable about P&P's offerings. He never left us too long between serving tasks, which is greatly appreciated. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals which ranged from the BLT, the Dip, Grilled Cheese/Soup, Beet salad, the Tri tip and my Farmers salad. My Farmers salad was fresh and flavorful: fresh greens, grape tomatoes, nuts, a very healthy serving of goat cheese and bacon. Not just any old average bacon, but incredibly delicious and thick bacon. This salad usually comes with a buttermilk Ranch but I wanted something lighter so William brought me the apple cider vinaigrette which was the perfect was to dress this healthy salad in my opinion.

I ordered their famous doughsant and was excited to share it with my tablemates however when I stuck my fork in to it to hold the doughsant while I cut a piece with my knife, I had to saw through a very hard pastry. Surely, it isn't supposed to be like that, right?? One other person managed to cut through the pastry and try a bite and she said it seemed stale. I felt so disappointed! When William came to clear our plates he saw my uneaten doughsant and asked about it. He was surprised and said it is supposed to be flaky but this thing was not so much flaky as it was just plain old hard. He immediately apologized and said he would remove it from my bill. 

I am anxious to come back to P&P and have breakfast along with a fresh doughsant.

Breakfast here is anything but the ordinary.  A very upscale place located in a renaissance area of older Tucson, the prices are still very reasonable.  The breakfast selections are eclectic but not crazy.  The general vibe is a very feminine place, as are the primary clientele - the food was great, just check your testicles at the door.

Offerings range from homemade granola/yogurt to slow cooked pork belly.  Of note was the tri tip sandwich, which I saw an adjoining diner eating and it looked quite tasty.  In addition to tables, P & P has a small counter with maybe 6 or 8 stools.  The counter is noteworthy because you can see directly into Chef Kara's active pastry kitchen, where she is busy making all the fresh pastries, muffins, breads and other baked goods either used in the dishes or offered for sale at the counter.

I really enjoyed the eggs Benedict, served on a freshly baked cheese biscuit.  It was supposed to have slow cooked pork belly on top, but a tech snafu delayed the availability of the pork so I substituted bacon.   It was a petite portion, which actually was a good thing.  Quite tasty and the hollandaise well executed.  I can only imagine how much better it would have been with the pork.  They also serve a damn good cup of not Starbucks coffee.

Even though it's only been open a couple of weeks, P & P is a popular place and a line waiting for seating quickly forms.  The flow is good and the wait is reasonably short.",27/1/2014 16:01

LONG STORY:
Seeing the reviews, my wife and I decided to go here for brunch earlier today. Unfortunately, we had picked out some items on the menu that we saw in pictures, but the weekend menu is different from the weekday menu.

There was a 15 minute wait when we arrived (12:30 PM on a Saturday). The donuts/croissants had already been sold out for the day, but the waiter suggested a bread pudding which was actually quite good.

My wife ordered the chicken and French toast, requesting the Smore's French toast instead of the one that comes with the dish. The waiter was more than willing to accommodate. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich.

When the meal arrived, we started with the chicken and toast. The fried chicken was exceptional, with a little bit of kick and perfectly moist. We had ordered the Smore's French toast, which the waiter delivered, but he also brought the berry compote in case we felt inclined to try it. It was a good call, as we liked the berry even more than the Smore's toppings.

Then it came time to eat my grilled cheese sandwich. The tomato bisque with which it came was fantastic, but the sandwich itself tasted like something had turned. It was somewhat malodorous, and certainly not balanced like the rest of the meal had been. In fact, it killed my appetite.

Without me having to tell anyone or call over a waiter, someone came over and asked if everything was okay. He was obviously watching the restaurant to make sure everything was in order. I told him about the sandwich and he informed me that the tomatoes are soaked in tea, which is sometimes too pungent for the customers. I doubted that that was the problem, because I enjoy exploring new kinds of food, but before I could say anything, he said he wanted to give me another menu item so he could make sure I left ""ecstatic"" about my meal :-) I thanked him, requesting the tri-tip sliders.

When he came back out with the sliders, he told me that he checked with the kitchen, and it seemed that they had mis-balanced the the lavender with the mint in the pesto. They decided to discard the rest of their pesto, a sign of really caring about their product.

The tri-tip sliders were excellent, including the biscuits which the meat was on, the eggs, the meat itself, and the potato hash. (See pictures of all the above).

When it came time to pay the bill, it appeared the price was far too low. I asked the waiter what happened, and he said that they had removed both the sliders and the grilled cheese sandwich from the check. That was a very nice surprise! As I was leaving, I went to thank the man who had come around to see if everything was okay. It turns out that he is the owner, Nathan!

What a rare treat to see the owner of an establishment so invested in the service of the restaurant. I will certainly recommend this place and come back again! :-)",3/8/2014 2:17

My boyfriend and his father ordered the Chefs Omelette.

1418,1351,1,5,0,0,2,"Had Brunch here for the first time today. Judging by the patronage and by the plates coming from out of the kitchen I knew I was going to be in for a delight. It was my last meal in Tucson before heading back to Orange County. I wish It would have been my first meal when I got to town. Then I could have tried the other items on the menu that were speaking to my ravenous stomach. 

Just reading over the menu will put you in a state of voraciousness, then after a sever bout of indecisiveness, maybe more so to the fact that everything was appealing to my now tortured and wanting tastebuds, I committed to the Breakfast Poutine. How can you go wrong with house made fries topped with pork belly and cheese curds enrobed in duck fat gravy and crowned with two over easy eggs cooked with the care of someone who takes pride in even the most commonplace of breakfast fare, the fried egg. I personally put a lot of credence in the quality of a breakfast by how well the eggs are cooked. Nothing can ruin the start of your day quicker than Eggs Benedict with over cooked yolks or a fried egg with that wire like edge and soufflï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ like bottom. Judging by the eggs alone, Prep & Pastry should be listed in the Michelin Guide with 3 Stars or at a minimum a Bib Gourmand. My elation for the eggs was bolstered when I passed my first forkful of this coalescence of singularly ambrosial gastronomic elements past my lips and onto my unprepared taste buds. My culinary nerve endings were revved into overdrive with the deluge of sapid flavors, savoring that memorable first bite my brain received the conclusion of the masticatory interrogation conducted by my now placated sense of taste, resulting in a smile and an overwhelming feeling of gratification, and an urge to repeat the just articulated act of conveying the exquisiteness from fork to mouth. 

To sum it all up, I love breakfast, be it Waffle House at 2:00 am with some scattered, smothered, covered, chunked, peppered and just for good measures topped hash browns. This is codeorder of hash browns on the grill smothered in onions, covered with a slice of cheese, chunked ham,  jalapeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½os and topped with Berts Chili to complete that train wreck i'm hoping will be the proper medicine to stave off the inevitable hangover. Or the Best of Orange County Eggs Benedict's at Willy's Eatery in Anaheim, CA. Prep & Pastry in Tucson, AZ is now the yardstick that all others endeavoring in the culinary art of breaking one's fast will be held up to and measured against. 

At the table: Breakfast Poutine, Return of the Mac (Vegetarian & Gluten Free), Biscuit""Cure"" French Toast. Beverages: House Bloody Mary w/local beer back (very good), Orange Juice w/free refills, Fuzzy Naval. Everything was beyond good. The only thing I could find wrong was the water. I don't know how Tucsonan's drink this.

 I would make the 7-8 hour drive from Orange County just to partake in the arduous task of choosing one of the many amazing menu items that will satisfy a craving that now only Prep & Pastry can satisfy. Ever consider a breakfast sampler platter?",12/7/2018 6:06

The restaurant menu, to-go menu, AND online menu priced both foods at $8.50, but we were charge $11.50 and $13.00 for them. We would have been okay with a $1 increase, but $5 increase on a dish is uncalled for.

Classic French toast - 5 stars, this is a dish that you're literally missing out if you don't get it.

Tri-tip sliders - Amazing tri tip, and the jalapeno jam is not spicy but flavourful

Monte Cristo - my favourite - TONS of flavour without being a handful to eat.

The Bacon Lucy - The bacon and meat pattie are EPIC - the egg adds a terrific touch as well. The cheese is STRONG but compliments the dish very well.

Service was excellent end to end, very friendly, helpful, professional and attentive. I don't have anything bad to say about the place.

Seems strange... how hard is it to offer a simple veggie tofu scramble and maybe some vegan pancakes?

Note to the owners... we make AMAZING vegan pancakes at home that are famous amongst our friends and we have a Great recipe my wife made up that she just might share with you ;) using buckwheat flour and egg replacer and vanilla. 

You open up to this and a whole lot more of people might be stoked to eat there...

I eat mostly vegan but ordered pescatarian for the day.

The service at this place is top notch too. I was even brought a togo iced tea by our waiter when he dropped off the check! Now what other places have you been too that do that?? The ONLY problem I have with this place is that the wait is almost always at least 30 minutes on weekends and there is nowhere to wait inside.

1502,1431,1,3,0,0,0,"This is a very popular place, and I can understand why. The atmosphere is really fun and there's an obvious effort to put out plates that are unique and delicious. There was a short wait before we were seated and it seems we were just in time, because behind us the crowd became quite large. I was a bit taken aback by the bar operating at such an early hour, but I get the premise; ""Brunch without booze is just a sad, late breakfast"" is emblazoned on the wall! The menu is quite varied, but save for a few basics (2 eggs and choice of meat, basic pancakes with berries) all of the dishes are unique takes. I opted for one of these unique takes and, unfortunately, it just didn't hit the spot for me. The dish in question is their version of biscuits and gravy; made here with cheddar biscuits and duck fat gravy. The problem didn't lie in the flavors; those were acceptable, though not an improvement on the traditional preparation. The problem was with the proportions. I was given four whole biscuits, which is just too much, and only enough gravy for 2, maybe 3 biscuits. I literally set an entire biscuit to the side of my bowl and didn't eat it; and the remaining biscuits were still too dry. Oh, by the way, yes, I said bowl. It seems everything is served in oblong bowls here instead of on plates. This was also an issue, since I couldn't scrape gravy together from the dish with my fork because of the curvature of the bowl. I also couldn't sop the gravy up with a piece of biscuit because they were dry and crumbly, making them impossible to swipe around the dish without them just falling apart. Maybe if I had a spoon I would have been able to get a little more gravy on the biscuits, but it still wouldn't have been enough. My wife ordered their classic French toast, which was pretty straightforward, other than the chai butter and candied almonds. There wasn't anything wrong with this dish but, unfortunately for these folks, she had French toast the morning before that was just superior to this one. I must give a shout out to the side of bacon that she ordered though; it was the best damn bacon I've had in a long time, maybe ever. I also got a pastry to go, which was a peanut butter and hazelnut, chocolate Danish of sorts. I ate it later in the day and it was really good.",8/4/2018 22:51

1520,1446,1,1,0,0,0,"Please consider...

We the residential neighbors in this area ask you to please reconsider whether Prep n Pastry deserves your business.

Prep n Pastry is a business that is a very bad neighbor.  They have inadequate parking and are unwilling to take steps they could easily take to end the congestion (with fender benders and road rage incidents), residential street parking, and other issues they are causing.  Our kids are being accosted by inebriated customers leaving their restaurant. Restaurant goers are leaving trash in our yards and getting into fights with each other over parking spots.  While we appreciate that you yourself would not be so thoughtless, some customers, perhaps because they are encouraged by Prep n Pastry to drink alcohol so early in the day, are very impolite (to say the least).

Prep n Pastry could easily end the traffic and parking issues - and your long wait for a table at the same time - by switching to a reservation system.  They could also work with other neighboring business owners to share parking, but they refuse to do either in good faith.  They claim a reservation system would cost them profits - they can move more customers in and out if customers are constantly waiting - and a manager  for Prep n Pastry even said they want customers to wait because they make more money that way.  This waiting, however, means much more parking is needed.  One wonders about potential fire code violations and health and safety issues when they are moving so many people through so small a space.

Prep n Pastry also runs very noisy equipment at sometimes 3am! and 4am in the morning while cleaning their restaurant and grounds, waking us all up at unreasonable times even on work days -- when they could have such done in the afternoon after they close at no trouble to them.

So please consider taking your business instead to the many fine restaurants in this area that are good neighbors - who don't have such greedy and selfish practices - and who don't make their customers wait as much as an hour or more for a seat!

Thank you!",26/5/2016 13:54

I tried their chicken & brie sandwich, and it was absolutely delicious and I wanted another to take home! It had blueberry fig (which initially drew my attention) and spinach with ciabatta bread. You could say it hit the jackpot for me and my tummy was in happyland afterward.

Their drinks are also pretty fantastic and refreshing for a hot summer day.  I had their blueberry lemon mimosa (see the running theme here?), and my friend had the Hemingway which was tasty and super sweet.

The price was affordable for our meals but, the only thing that would have made our brunch complete would be to have included a  selection of sides to go along with the main entrï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½es!  Just my humble opinion. :)

I want to thank Billy for being such a great server, there were a lot of us, and he was still very helpful and friendly with all our requests!  Now on to the food!  Being that it was an unofficial Yelp event, I was surprised that they let us sample a few of their menu items.  We were the first to try their chocolate chip french toast, which I thought was scrumptious!  We also got to try some doughsants! A maple bacon one, and a cinnamon sugar one!  Honestly, I've never tried these cronuts/doughsants yet, but after this, I'm hooked and will be coming by to get my fix more often. They're doughnuts made with croissant bread, very interesting! 

Now on to our entrees!  I love breakfast food, so I basically wanted to try everything 'cause everything sounded great!  But, that gives me reason to keep on coming back, right?  Anyways, I went ahead and ordered the breakfast poutine.  Now, for all of you who don't know what poutine is, it's a Canadian dish made with french fries, usually topped with a light brown gravy-like sauce and cheese curds.  My breakfast poutine came with pork belly, duck fat gravy, fries, cheese curds, & 2 over easy eggs! Yeah, yummers!  =)  Very flavorful, and definitely fulfilling!  My kiddos ordered the berry french toast, and the tri-tip sandwich, which they both enjoyed as well! I loved the fresh blueberries that were topped on my daughter's french toast!  I admit, I ate most of the berries 'cause she didn't want them!

Everyone around me had some very yummy looking dishes too!  And by the looks of it, we all enjoyed every bit of it!  So, I give this place 4 & 1/2 stars!  Great food & excellent service!

They were pretty busy when we walked in, so we put our name down and spent an enjoyable 20 minutes exploring the Native Seeds store just down the way.  I definitely recommend checking it out if you have a wait time.  If you're waiting, you could also grab a pastry or two to try before your meal.  Try the maple/bacon cronut if you're looking for something different and delicious (Protip: Don't try to cut it, it ruins the nice croissant ""fluffiness"").  

Down to the food.  We had just missed the breakfast menu (Their breakfast menu is served until 11, then is exchanged for their brunch menu) so my dreams of pork belly benedict were crushed.  I'm glad I wound up with the biscuits and duck fat gravy however, because they were absurdly delicious.  It definitely wasn't the bleached-white sausage gravy, but a flavorful sauce that went wonderfully with the buttery herb biscuits.  My boyfriend had the grilled cheese with pistachio pesto and the tomato bisque.  He's a traditionalist when it comes to grilled cheese and tomato soup, but still loved this meal. The grilled cheese had a great crunchy outside and a mix of cheeses/pesto that was really great with the tomato soup.

While we were waiting for the food, one of the owners came over to ask how we were doing and what we thought of the food etc.  They seem to really want to know their customers' opinions and areas they can develop.  Don't hesitate to approach the staff with any suggestions.  They also have a commitment to using local ingredients and are working with Edible Baja Arizona to get local produce etc. for the restaurant.  Always good to hear!

In a couple weeks they're going to start their ""high tea"" in the afternoons. Check out their Facebook page for updates.  I can't wait to take a couple friends and try it out.  Delicious tea and scones in one of their window seats sounds just like....my cup of tea!  ;)",13/1/2014 4:42

1591,1510,1,2,2,0,1,"I tried brunch today and was really excited by the menu.  For Tucson the menu comes across as really creative, especially for an establishment that only does breakfast/brunch.  However, the execution of the menu is poor.  

As for the food, the side order of ""hash"" looks and tastes like frozen potatoes heated to lukewarm.  There is no flavor in the hash and it kind of looks like something served at a school lunch.  I had the Pork Belly Breakfast Sandwich.  I liked that it was blending apples with the pork belly, but the pork belly was extremely tough and chewy it was like eating a tough steak with inedible chunks of fat.  Also the apples were raw and while it kind of looked interesting the raw apple bits didn't really pair well with the egg or pork.

I did enjoy the atmosphere and service was pretty good.  I would go back again if they had espresso based drinks and maybe just get a pastry.  I wanted to like this place so much it looks really cute but the food was just a disappointment.",14/11/2015 23:51

1604,1520,1,2,3,0,0,"I went to Prep and Pastry two Sundays ago, it was 10am. I was excited to try this restaurant after noticing the good Yelp reviews.

I have to say, I wasn't impressed. To be fair I will try it again, but for now I am only giving the experience two stars.

I arrived ahead of my two breakfast companions. There was a little bit of a wait 10-15 minutes. Waiting outside in the full sun was terrible. There isn't anywhere inside to wait. I watched people choose patio seats, more power to them. I just wouldn't have been able to enjoy a meal outside, it was just too hot. One woman on the patio was asking for a highchair. I observed the waiter telling her they were all being used, and that he didn't have one to give her.

We were sat inside close to the door. This is a very loud restaurant when it is full and we were literally shouting at each other.

My friends ordered Blood Marys and I ordered  a white tea with coconut ($3). Our server said she preferred it to the sweet orange white tea I was also considering. It was ok, but I wouldn't order it again. I do like that I was given more hot water without having to ask for it. As for the Bloody Marys, they came with a side of beer. I thought it was a good beer when I tried a sip of it, but my friend who order it left it untouched.

We asked what the server suggested and she recommended the pork belly sandwich and the French toast and chicken combination. I remembered reading that the pork belly ($9) was good so I gave it a try.

I really didn't like the sandwich. It had an over easy egg on it which made it quite messy. The bottom bun was wet and soggy. Wet bread is gross. If I had to guess I would say it was trapped steam or something. I hope it wasn't put on a wet plate. It wasn't wet from the condiments, it was wet from the bottom. The pork belly itself was tasty but greasy- of course. The potatoes that came with it were just barely ok, nothing special.

Overall I don't think the plate was worth the money or calories, which was too bad because I love a decadent Sunday brunch.",20/7/2014 21:52

I had not had biscuits and gravy for a very long time so I thought I'd give it a chance.  I ordered it with 2 eggs over easy and an order of bacon, and a screwdriver. Eggs very good. 2 thick slices bacon cooked just right. And the screwdriver hit the spot. However... the biscuits were not that great: heavy and too much, and not nearly enough gravy. And altogether it was too salty for my taste  (others might disagree). With standard tip it cost me $25.
If I'm in the area I would go again to try other items on the menu. Looking around at what people had they looked pretty good.

We went for brunch and there was about a 20 minutes wait, not bad for a Sunday morning! We were seated at the bar, not my favorite place to eat but I was hungry so that was ok. Our server brought us water and we also ordered the lemonade, not your typical out of the soda machine lemonade was a pleasant surprise. 

I ordered the Tri-Tip Sandwich and it was REALLY good. The tri-tip was well cooked and the eggs were perfectly seasoned. It was on a house made cheddar biscuit which was flaky and not too dense. The only thing I would change was more jalapeno jam. The sanwich also came with hash and the potatoes were good and were cooked with peppers and onions.

My boyfriend ordered the AM Relleno and he loved it. It was well prepared and the flavors balanced each other nicely. The crispy things on top (i think tortilla strips) were yummy and added a nice crunch. 

By the time we had gotten there most of their pastries had been sold so we only had the choice of a chocolate chip cookie or a regular scone. We ordered the cookie and were pleasantly surprised when the server said it was on him! Woohoo! A free cookie.

Another issue was that my girlfriend ordered her dish with the S'mores French Toast as opposed to the normal Rosemary French Toast with Blueberry compote, when the dish was coming out we saw the server stop it and only brought one of the dishes out saying that the other dish was taking an extra minute because of the S'mores addition. It came out with clearly wiped off blueberry compote on each piece of french toast, this was not a huge issue for us as she asked to change it on a personal preference but if she had an allergy that could have ended horribly.

All of that said I still rate it 4 stars because everything I've ever had has been incredibly tasty and the service has been amazing. Each time I've been our server has been incredibly attentive and a manager has come to check on us and ask how our meal was and we've been given a free pastry after our meal.

I could only eat one biscuit.  My dining partner went with the egg beni which had pork belly, asparagus, and subbed biscuit for the English Muffin.

I've been owing you guys this review for a while. First, the place is well decorated, clean, and inviting. Every member of the staff is well-trained and makes you feel like they're genuinely glad to have you.

The food is great, everything is sourced as locally as possible. There was absolutely nothing that didn't seem perfectly fresh. I would be surprised if they even have a freezer.

However, none of the above is consequential compared to their Bloody Mary...They make it all in-house, and it is ridiculously good. The first drink I took stopped me mid-sentence. I had to collect my thoughts about how good it was. Favorite part? The garnish made sense. Enough to be interesting, more than the standard lime or single celery stalk, but not so crazy like recent trends. I do not need a slider or a grilled cheese sandwich sticking out of my drink, thank you.

One last thing, these guys are local. Which means they are present, and they care. By going here, you're also doing the rest of us a favor by keeping your money here in Tucson.

The menu isn't vast, but it offers something for everyone.  The items are traditional with an upscale twist like duck fat biscuits and gravy.  (I ordered an additional side of gravy, that's the good stuff.)  There is some southwest influence in jalapeno jellies and stuffed chili relleno's for breakfast, but classics like French toast and pancakes are on the menu as well.  Really a well thought out offering with something for everyone.

The space is tight, and I can imagine weekends are a headache.  If you're lucky enough to be able to brunch on a weekday this is your spot.  Get in, sit in the comfortable atmosphere, and have a mimosa or two with a good friend or loved on.

I had the pork belly breakfast sandwich and was very happy with it.  Thick slab of pork belly, fried egg over medium, topped with slivers of granny smith apple and fennel on a generously buttered brioche bun (even though I asked for mine butter-free, but that's okay). It was served with cutely cut potato squares/fries which were well seasoned and not too greasy. 

A lot of items on their menu sounded and looked really good and I have found myself daydreaming about their doughsants, which I have yet to try. This is like a homey but fancy brunch place with some super trendy and pretty looking dishes and drinks.

The Biscuits and Sausage Gravy were definitely not typical....more Moroccan or middle eastern in seasoning (very peppery and spicy).   Too much so.   The Veggie Beni (sort of a veggie  take on Eggs Benedict) was overwhelmingly rich between the eggs, hollandaise sauce (which I think was made with duck fat instead of butter and no lemon), and the large avocado patty.

Here was my first issue....we were literally waited on by 4 different people. One person sat us. One took a drink order. Another brought us the check. Another took the check. It was strange. In my opinion, I like to know who  my tip is going to. And while I know that a lot of places tip out to everyone involved...I felt like it just took away from the personal service. But Joel, our main waiter, was extremely sweet and accommodating. 

I ordered coffee, and the ""chef's whim"" omelet. It had shallots, cheese and broccolini, with a side of ""hash"". And my friend ordered the french toast. 

The coffee was good and strong and not bitter. I wish I'd asked what they brew. The food came and my friends french toast was cold. Joel (the waiter) offered to box it up and bring her a new plate, which he did. And he even tried to comp it later, but my friend (who is the sweetest most wonderfully community-minded person on the planet) said she wanted to pay to support local business. Yay. 

My omelet was huge. took up half the plate. And it was pretty delicious. The potatoes were bland and a non-event. Now, I can throw down on some home fries. Love them. But these were not of such caliber. They were cubes of underseasoned potatoes with red peppers thrown in. I had a few bites and pushed them aside to finish the omelet. I was also amazed that at $8.50, there wasn't even one toast point.

All in all, my breakfast (omelet, potatoes, and coffee) cost me $16 including tip. I wouldn't have minded paying that if the potatoes were better. I was underwhelmed. 

BUT, I'm going to go back and give them another shot and update my review when I do. I figure, we have to do our best to support local efforts. So, get your cronuts ready, P&P, I'm comin' for ya!",22/5/2014 16:02

My husband's favorite is the Poutine. For those who don't know, it's a Canadian dish, that has French fries with eggs over easy, gravy and cheese curds. P and P adds pork belly. He absolutely loves it and won't order anything else. I always manage to snag a few bites and I can't disagree. 
The employees have always been very warm and helpful - this time it was Annal. There are several people ready to fill your coffee, and the coffee is really good.

It was decently busy but we were seated within 10 minutes. There was 3 of us and we decided to split 3 different things so we could get a good idea of this place. 

1. Apple French Toast: Outstanding. It was perfect and it had this spiced cream cheese that was to die for. I wish I could try all the other french toast options. Wow.
2. Biscuits and Gravy: Had a very nice spice level and was a solid dish. I would say it was slightly above average but nothing to write home about. 
3. Chef's Special: This was 5/5 and I cannot stop thinking about it. It was a short rib omelet and everything was so tender and fresh. It was so amazing. I dream about it.

We weren't offered coffee,  tea or dessert and were just given our check. Actually,  we were given someone else's check first.

We ordered our meals and unfortunately mine came out with mushrooms after I ordered my omelet without them. The waiter immediately took it back and was very apologetic. During my wait, my water and coffee cup kept being re-filled and the owner came out with a very delicious pastry which I had not ordered.

He apologized for the inconvenience and introduced himself as the owner. He treated me to the pastry as I waited for my meal.

1801,1693,1,3,4,0,1,"It certainly isn't ""bad"" - but it's certainly not ""amazing"" either... We went around 10:30 on a weekday, hoping to avoid the worst crowds... Wait was still about 20 minutes and that was asking for ""first available"" table - i.e. of course that ended up being on the outside patio... And while the patio is covered (a HUGE plus), there are no misters/fans and the flies were RELENTLESS! Personally I don't mind the heat so long as I'm in the shade, but if you are sensitive to sitting in the heat, best to ask/wait for an indoor table... The flies, however, were another story...
Now, to the food... We ordered a Monte Cristo, an apple strussle french toast and an order of sweet potato hash... The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything spectacular/out-of-the-ordinary either... What I mean to say is, overall, don't think it's worth the wait/hype... I'd be just as happy at any number of other breakfast places around town... their food is just as good and with half the wait.
All that being said, I do not want to bash this place at all - it's certainly not awful, my personal opinion is just that it is more hype than anything... but, to each his own I guess. I should also mention that we did not, in fact, try any of the pasteries... so perhaps that is what we were missing?? I'd be willing to go back, and try other things off the menu, just to see...

I've never visited Amelia Grey's so I can't speak for that, but it's cute inside and looks like a cozy and casual place to grab breakfast/lunch. It was so busy when my husband and I went, we were seated in the back and greeted promptly. Our server, don't remember her name, but she wasn't overly friendly and seemed annoyed to have another table. I've been a server before too...I get it, but at least try not to let it show you know? It looked like it was just her working with another man. I wish we would have had him instead- MUCH friendlier and didn't seem annoyed to be there. We asked about what teas were offered, and she pointed over at a row of glass jars where the tea was displayed. Sooo...I guess I'll go look for myself. Ordinarily I wouldn't be put off by this I guess, but I had my little girl with me and didn't really want to have to get up and block traffic just to look at some tea. There were only maybe 10 kinds....couldn't our server give us a quick rundown of what was there? Whatever. 
The food is rich but good. I ordered the biscuits and gravy and my husband ordered the tri-tip sandwich. The sandwich didn't taste good and he actually got sick before we even made it home, and was throwing up for the rest of the day.....so don't know if I would order that again.

The ambiance and the restaurant itself looks really nice inside. However, I think the praises for the food and drinks that I've heard from people, I think are more just like a hype. I ordered the madras mimosa(made with guava+orange juice+champagne) and for food, I ordered the Monte Cristo. I didn't really taste the guava in the mimosa and the Monte Cristo was okay but also was too salty. If solely judged by appearance and presentation, my order would get 5/5 but in terms of flavor it really is more just a 2-3/5. 

It's a nice, cozy brunch place however the food and drinks kinda disappoint...I may have to try other stuff on the menu to really see what they're about and to really know what all the hype was for...if I could get a table the next time",3/7/2016 2:04

Our two French Toast breakfasts took about 20-25 minutes to come out.  The Chef's Special, which included two eggs, was lukewarm to cold.  My suspicion is that our meals sat unattended for a while before being delivered.  HOWEVER, when we told our waiter, he apologized profusely, and offered to bring something else, or to make the dish again.  We declined, but he said he'd alert the kitchen manager.  Sure enough, the manager came by, apologized, asked for details so that he could talk to the kitchen staff.  Then, they comped us the Special, and gave us a gigantic scone to take with.

Fancy breakfasts is what Prep & Pastry is all about, though don't think small portions that are pretentious and don't actually taste all that good. There are a wealth of great options on the menu, and so far my favorite is the Tri Tip Breakfast Sandwich. Calling it a ""sandwich"" is a little misleading though since the thing is impossible to pick up and eat as one, but take a fork and knife to this thing and it's heaven on a plate. 

The whole reason I wound up at Prep & Pastry in the first place was the mystery known as the Cronut (or Doughssant, though even our waiter called it by it's much better name). This is a croissant fried like a doughnut and it's magical. Prep & Pastry has three kinds and I would encourage you to try all three and see which one is the best. 

Sitting outside is advised, though be warned there are a lot of flies buzzing around this time of year.

1869,24,1,4,2,1,1,"HIGH TEA REVIEW: A group of us (7) came for high tea on Sunday afternoon. We had a reservation and our table was pretty much ready as soon as we arrived. The price is $15 a person. You are allowed two different types of teas that come in little french presses. I had the madagascar coconut which was PHENOMENAL. Sadly, it took the restaurant about 45 minutes to serve us the hors d'oeuvres, which I thought was a little long seeing how we had a reservation so they knew we were coming. The first round were little bites that weren't all that special. The bruschetta was pretty yummy though. Then we had the pastries. So. many. pastries. A little too many for my liking actually (and I LOVE pastries). I think it ends up being about 5 pasties a person, I would have liked 3 at the most. The bread pudding bite was absolutely delectable. But towards the end, we were all feeling pretty sick and ended up leaving several pastries there. Overall it was a pleasant experience, I would have just preferred maybe a little more hors d'oeuvres and less pastries.

Also, they need to do something about the fly situation. It was REALLY annoying.",19/8/2014 19:18

French toast and bacon were excellent!  High quality, tasty slab bacon, and the french toast had excellent cinnamon, and berry flavor.
Pork belly sand was awesome. Excellent flavor combination with five spice, fennel and apple, egg and pork.  My only complaint was that the pork belly was undercooked and chewy, with the fat not completely rendered, but the flavors made up for it.
The croissant was the best I have had since we stopped in a little French bakery in Seattle, would definitely come back just for that!!
Wait times are long, but since they are one of the few foodie joints in tucson I can see why.  Prices are equal to what you get, but people who just want greasy spoon diner food will be unhappy.

1933,749,1,4,3,1,1,"This is a review for both the pastries and the sit-down service.

Atmosphere/Seating: 5/5
Extremely cute decorating, wood decor, very enjoyable.

Service: 5/5
It's awkward coming in, they don't have someone constantly standing up front seating people, but response was quick and we were seated within minutes. Our server was pleasant, a little bit of a quiet talker, but still very attentive. When I stated my problem about my food they were quick to respond and the manager personally came and sat down with us to apologize. He also gave us a free scone for the inconvenience.

Food: 3/5
I had the monte cristo which by itself was very tasty. I found it to be semi-soggy on the edges but it still had a nice crunch in the middle. My first serving of hash however was extremely salty. Like I stated earlier they responded quickly and got me a new batch which was good. Unfortunately I'm still not a fan because I found the potatoes still be a little uncooked. Might just be me. My husband had the dip which unfortunately was also salty but bearable to eat but the au jus was not, extremely salty there as well. I don't think that would be something we will order again. The fried however that came with the dip were excellent, I could eat them all day. The strawberry scone that we got for free was excellent, moist, and worth buying. We bought 2 cronuts before we left and we are fans! Maple glaze, bacon pieces, crunch, AMAZING.

Overall: 4/5
Service was impeccable but they definitely need to lessen the salt in all their food. We will be back to sample more of their menu.",23/1/2014 21:13

I'm typically an old fashioned - eggs, toast, and sausage - type of person, but the couple of times I've gone to P&P I couldn't help but order the Duck Confit Hash or the Duck Poutine.  

Both dishes were very well done, the Poutine was the best I've had this side of the International Boundary (it's a Canadian dish).  The Hash mixed together into a nice savory, salty mixture, with a nice sweet brightness from the cherries.  In both dishes the duck really shined by adding a tender, richness to the affair.

Aside from the food service was great.  I know this was an issue when they first opened, but they've made some adjustments to dinning area to help ensure better service.  It was also very nice to have the owners stop by the table and ask how the experience was each time I went there.

The decor seemed more or less lifted from Pinterist, and it comes together to make a bright, inviting setting.  The white and navy blue color scheme is very welcoming and the wood tables are a nice cozy accent.

I was really looking forward to checking out this place based on some of the reviews. We walked in and were greeted by an empty hostess desk. We must have made eye contact with at least 5 different employees, none of which bothered to greet us or offer any help. They just stared and went about their way (just walking around it seemed and chatting with each other). After waiting for what seemed an eternity,  we thought, silly us, you must just write your own name on the list.  

Lo and behold the rude hostess decided to finish her interesting chat at the end of the restaurant as we were touching her sacred wait list pad. She seemed baffled that we would dare to do this and we were even more horrified that not one apology was extended for the unnecessary wait time and rudeness we experienced. The staff might  want to get organized as it seemed they were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off or management should invest in a bit more in training their employees.",13/1/2014 16:19

I might have another in a year. I think the flavor was green tea or something, I can't exactly remember.

You can also order from the bar and start in your mimosas, as we did. I tried the Prickly Pear Mimosa and was immediately in love. You can see and taste the freshness in their drinks. It's obvious they put a lot of care and effort into their food and drinks.

It was busy but I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere. I wore a tiara for my birthday and received several high fives and well-wishes from the staff. The waiter brought me a scone with a candle in it, and he wrote ""Happy Birthday"" on my to-go containers, a nice touch.

Onto the food. Everything looked delicious. I had 8 different things I wanted to order! I ordered the cheddar biscuits with duck fat gravy with a side of potatoes. The potatoes are clearly fresh (not chopped from a bag like some places) and wonderfully seasoned. The gravy was fattening and delicious. On the heavier side, but what else would you expect from gravy? It was heavenly. The dish also had some sausage crumbles on top, bursting with bits of flavor.

1968,1838,1,4,8,6,6,"Ugh. Was craving a salad after a Saturday AM work-out, but after perusing the menu at Prep and Pastry, I decided to get the poutine. Which is like, the opposite of a salad. Well it's kind of a salad except you substitute greens for french fries, feta cheese for a large layer of melted cheese curds, and balsamic vinaigrette for gravy made from duck fat...

But this poutine was worth every calorie. I've had poutine before in Quebec and while this isn't exactly authentic, it's so delicious that it makes me not care that it's not authentic. There are two interesting twists: bits of pork belly and over-easy eggs, both of which enhance the dish. The fries are freshly cut and perfectly crisp, and the duck fat gravy...  man, I could just take a bath in it. My only complaint is that instead of the cheese curds being separate squeaky little bites, they end up all melted together as one thick layer of cheese under the eggs.

And they serve up quality coffee from Exo, a swift kick in the face for your Saturday morning (that's a good thing, if you can't tell!). They encourage you to get cocktails but I was still suffering a minor hangover from the night before (what's new?) so I abstained.

My friends got the pork belly breakfast sandwich and the Monte Cristo (a savory sandwich with french toast as the bread, yum!) and there were 0 complaints there.

Decor is rustic but also trendy, down to the glassware they use. Service is attentive. Some minor negatives: not enough room in the parking lot for the typical Saturday AM (ended up parking on the street) and a 20 minute wait turned into a ~30 minute wait.

I've been there a few times and I think my last visit a few weeks ago definitely sealed the deal for me. I ordered the sweet potato hash for breakfast which I hadn't tried before. I was excited about it because it listed lots of different veggies in the ingredients. I really enjoyed it but noticed that it was mostly sweet potato with just a sprinkling of the other veggies. I guess the waitress noticed me poking around my dish and she asked if everything was ok and I said yes, that I was just looking for more asparagus. A few minutes later a manager came out with a bowl full of veggies for me. He said the waitress came back and told him that there wasn't enough in there for me and that next time I should just mention that when I order it to make sure it comes out exactly like I want.

Driving down Campbell, just out of the corner of my eye, there was Prep and Pastry.  Serving breakfast until 11 and lunch until 3, we arrived at about noon.  The place is quaint and adorable, tucked away in a shopping center at Hedrick and Campbell.  If they get any more popular, they will need to acquire a new parking lot - the place was busy, with more business arriving throughout our whole meal and while we were leaving.

The tables were clean, the silverware clean, and the chairs were comfortable - we sat outside because it was a beautiful day.  The servers dress casually and are attentive.  The water is very filtered and crisp.  This all set the stage for something I never would have expected - for a new restaurant to immediately join such giants as Jonathan and Odell in a haunting dining experience.

THE CUBANO.  Their take on this 'classic' sandwich marries a lean and gristle free, thinly sliced, generous heap of ham with a subdued, tender and moist duck confit.  Other times that I have had this sandwich, it was served with pulled pork - and what a shame the other times were!  This sandwich is outstanding - the burst of flavors enters your taste buds as a meteor entering the atmosphere.  A stone ground mustard, along with long sliced pickles, the cheese, and the locally made bread that they use - divinity.  For only $10 with a side of delicious fries and ketchup served in an actual ramekin and not to-go plastic ware WOOHOO!

Da Vinci worked in oil and canvas, Chopin worked in etudes and nocturnes - and Prep and Pastry works in food.  Thank you for an experience I will never forget.",12/3/2014 5:56

I enjoyed the biscuits and gravy. The cranberry juice was very sweet and probably could've been less concentrated. To be fair, I didn't have a pastry, but the biscuit from the biscuits and gravy was quite good. Prep and Pastry just did not live up to the hype for me.

Positives:
+ Ultra cute atmosphere with navy blue chalkboard walls filled with cute pictures and quotes, mixture of large metal fixture and wood structures make it feel lofty-country-chic ...lol i don't even know if that makes sense but its nice to eat somewhere that I don't feel like I'm overdressed when I'm wearing a cute tea dress.  
+ All teas are high quality loose leaf teas that come out in a sizeable tea press that can be shared OR refilled with more hot water.  I drink a lot of tea in one sitting so I'm happy about this!
+ Creative menu.  It has the classics with a twist.
+ LOCAL 
+ Good looking waitresses and waiters -- hey, its a positive.

2027,1889,1,4,2,1,2,"After arriving in Tucson to visit my friend, Ben, we decided that brunch was a necessity at a local place. 

First off, the place is very welcoming. Plenty of sun with just the right amount of AC? Yes. Friendly, professional staff with attentive service? Absolutely. Turnaround time after ordering? Great. 

I ordered the braised short rib sandwich. The rib was fantastic, and the roll it was on was wonderfully soft and perfectly toasted. The apple slaw, which I've never had anything like before, was the perfect cool garnish to the rib and egg. 

Ben ordered the apple strudel french toast, which was wonderfully sweet and fruity and a sizable portion. 

The coffee was very robust, and while I'm more of a tea guy, I did enjoy it. 

Finally, we ordered a Tucson special--a doissant-- a fusion of croissant and donut. The blood orange one was VERY sweet. While I do have a sweet tooth, the amount of frosting was slightly overwhelming. 

I would definitely come back.",3/6/2015 17:45

I had the omelet, with potatoes, that was also very good. The menu had creative takes on traditional breakfast foods. 

The only reason I cannot get this place five stars is that shortly after we sat out on the patio, another couple came in with two large dogs. Not only were the dogs all over our table but then laid down blocking our ability to get up and our waiter's ability to serve our table. Now I understand that this is not the fault of the restaurant for the dogs but it I do not go out to eat expecting to have to ask someone to keep their large dog from sniffing my food.

The venue is stylish and very casual, with a patio for outdoor seating. We thought with the chalk signs, furnishing, and layout, this restaurant could easily blend into San Francisco (though this thought may be because we just haven't been out of the West Coast enough?) Anyways, onto the food...

I ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich, served with a generous portion of potatoes. The Monte Cristo was a fairly standard take on the recipe. The cheese was a little sharp for my test, but otherwise a comfort-food kind of meal. The potatoes were very crispy, which, on any other day, I would have loved (but I had just caught a cold). Lastly, the dish was served with home made strawberry jam, which was very fragrant and balanced.

My girlfriend had the Smores French toast. One could have guessed it was very sweet... but sounds and looks enticing! We finished only about half of it before the sweetness was too much.

So much love and thought goes into this food; it comes out looking like a work of art. Not only that, but the restaurant itself is open to light and simplistically beautiful, and the employees and owner are friendly and take good care of you! 

My perspective is vegetarian. I've tried a few varieties of french toast (so good! Easter carrot cake french toast was my fav!), sweet potato hash (I'm obsessed with the dollop of herbed mousse), grilled cheese (wow!), and simple breakfast (you can sub potatoes for fruit and you get actual delicious berries and fruit, not garnish scraps like Cup Cafe). 

My husband is a gluten free meat eater (I know, we are an odd pair!). He really likes the Cubano with gluten free English Muffin or the Duck Confit hash. Sometimes the restaurant will have other gf breads if you ask, but not all the time. 

Finally, the coffee is an amazing Exo Roast blend, I think it's a special one for the restaurant, and they'll even give you a to-go cup to take some home with you! If you can, their hot chocolate is literally the best I've tasted in the U.S.! They also have a variety of delicious fancy teas, and Kombucha on tap (I haven't tried that yet though!).

I know my review is super long, but I love this place, and that it exists in Tucson. I had at least three of my wedding celebration related gatherings here, and take all my out of town friends/family here to impress them with what our town has to offer!

I was so excited to finally get a table at this place after turning around twice after seeing the  line out the door!

However, once I finally got a table I realized that this place is way overhyped! Food was extremely rich but not in a good way. The dishes combined very strong flavors that sounded good on the menu but the combination was overwhelming to my tastebuds especially for a brunch. I had the monte cristo (a rich sandwich to begin with) but pretty sure after eating half of the sandwich I could feel my arteries starting to clog and harden.

2074,1928,1,5,2,0,1,"Decided to try out a breakfast spot near my brother's home and this was an unexpected surprise.

Atmosphere - Cute kitchen themed breakfast-brunch spot. They have all the fresh pastries lined up on racks for display between the restaurant and the kitchen. The bar area is laid out in a way to allow for lots of patrons to sit and eat. I found the whole decor to be very welcoming. 

Service - We were promptly seated at the bar where we had exceptional service from the bartender. We asked about the best Dissents that were available and were given a strong recommendation for the Churro-style. Our drinks were served quickly and were greeted throughout the meal asking if there was anything eel we needed. 

Bloody Mary - Not overly spicy, but enough tang to keep it sweet and bold. The toppings of cheese, salami, pickle, and olive were a great balance to the drink. I loved the small beer back that came with the order. A solid choice for a morning beverage ($5)

Churro Dossant - Recommended by the bartender as it was his, ""favorite flavor of dossant they make"". I have had many dossants, doughssants, or cronuts, but have found that many are greasy or fall apart once you bite into them. This one did not! It was a wonderfully light and fluffy pastry with a thick layer of cream cheese frosting that paired so well with the cinnamon and sugar. ($4)

Biscuits & Gravy - Cheddar biscuit, sausage, and duck fat gravy that sounds as good as it tasted! I could have used a little more gravy, but the flavors in every bite made it so wonderful! I added two eggs over easy for $2. ($6)

I was very impressed by the place overall and am hoping to go back and try more pastries and breakfast before i leave! Well done guys!",5/3/2016 17:24

Ambiance: it's like sitting in a big, cozy but edgy farmhouse kitchen - urban rustic with that nifty blue chalkboard wall. We sat inside, which is noisy and echoey, so chatting was a little challenging but it also means that I can take my kids there on another day. I saw a few other munchkins there and clearly, they were enjoying themselves. 

Drinks: Fresh OJ for the spouse and The Cure for me. Double-yum on both, and the Cure was oh so pretty too.

Food: Pork belly sandwich: portion just right, and while I don't eat much starch, the bit that I nibbled was delish. I was more focused on the pork belly, cured in house. Hubby much enjoyed the tri-tip sliders and the bite that I took was phenomenal. He wanted lunch, I wanted breakfast, and we both were completely satisfied. The dessert-for-breakfast options looked fantastic and the selection is creative and not overwhelming (I like a decent selection, but not a fifteen-page menu, and P&P's is just right) - raspberry pecan pancakes!

Service: attentive, interested and interesting, and they all seemed to be having fun and are really into the food. Good job. Maybe a little too attentive - at least 3 people came over to check on us right after we got our plates.

There is a children's menu that has 4 items on it for $5 each. (Egg breakfast, mini pancakes, pb&j sandwich, and one other item I can't remember).

We ordered biscuits and gravy. I expected a little bit of non-traditional but these turned out to be little cornbreads made with green chiles in the batter. They were served with a standard sausage biscuit gravy but just a light serving. There wasn't enough gravy to cover or make each piece of biscuit covered.

We also ordered classic french toast which was delicious. It was served with a raspberry fruit blend and warm maple syrup. 5 delicious pieces of french toast. 

The wait staff were all friendly. I noticed the hostesses were two females while all the servers and bussers were male. Having a beard and wearing a plaid shirt was also 'the look' for these guys.

We frequent this place at least twice a month if not more and in the last few months things have not been to the standard they usually are. Staff less attentive, sloppy even, it took almost 15 minutes for toast in a relatively slow atmosphere compared to the usual bustle that is Prep. And although the lox plate is out of this world, 2 oz of salmon seems very little for a ""Lox"" driven plate and when we asked for more of the fish (happy to pay more as well) it took an additional 15 minutes because (as our waiter informed us) it depended on the ""chef's mood"". 

Again, I want to say we LOVE this place and have a lot of respect for the owner and the staff and for the quality of food we get to eat but lately things have seemed ""off"" ... I hope this just serves as feedback not empty criticism.

A friends of mine got the montecristo, the commoners burger, and the pouting to name a couple of the dishes... all were incredible! I should know since I tried them all. I also loved how they give you free refills of your tea, chai, etc.

I didn't understand why it was called ""The"" Grilled Cheese instead of simply Grilled Cheese until I tried it. I love grilled cheese, and this was, hands down, the best one I have ever had. The tomato soup that went with it was also unreal, and the combination of the two together was almost more than my taste buds could handle! The Grilled Cheese is something you have to try, if you haven't already. It is absolutely perfect for a chilly winter day (or any other day, for that matter!).

Though it may sound strange, I am also thankful for a less than positive experience my friends and I had with a manager at the Grant location earlier this month. Because of that experience, I got to meet one of Prep & Pastry's owners, Sean. As my mother so eloquently phrased it, ""There are some people who are just meant to be in the restaurant business, and Sean is one of them. What a kind person!"". Sean has gone above and beyond to ensure that my opinion of Prep & Pastry is what it should be (rather than it being based on one negative experience): a fabulous brunch spot with a great atmosphere, caring staff and owners, and food that is so amazing you always have trouble deciding what to order.

I'm a BIG time Bruncher and have been dying to find a decent brunch place in Tucson that doesn't break the bank, provides great atmosphere, food and of course, brunch drinks ;). FINALLY, a place that rivals that of Postinos in Phoenix here in my cozy little town of Tucson. And best of all, only a few blocks North of me. 

Let's get down to the nitty gritty. We were told that there was about a 40 minute wait to be seated. No biggie, considering it was grad weekend we knew what we were getting into. We bellied up at the bar and ordered the infamous Watermelon Mimosa. Super great idea, however it is a little on the bitter side. Although, i will give propers as this is a great direction to be headed in. I think the puree may need some tweaking. 

We were finally seated and super anxious to get some food in our tipsy tummies. My friend suggested the Duck Confit Hash, and so that is what i went for. I am soo glad that i took her up on her suggestion because holy moly that dish was bomb.com! We all shared a bottle of champagne with a flight of juices. My fave was the blueberry lemon mimosa (i could be completely wrong with the name as i was pretty buzzed :P).

2269,2107,1,2,0,0,0,"I would like to start by saying I had high hopes for this restaurant as one of the owners, some of the patrons and several staff members run in circles I was acquainted with years ago. 

However, I was extremely disappointed in this restaurant.

When you pull up, there is quite a line of vapid young white foothillsians (which is never a good sign), but the host staff is pleasant and the quoted wait was spot on, twenty minutes. 

When we were called inside, I wanted to take in the charming rustic decor, and take some time to admire the typography, but there was this deafening roar... Between the concrete floors, bare walls, vaulted ceilings, and absurd amount of people milling about on foot I could only focus on getting to my seat which was sandwiched in a bay window with another two top. Needless to say the acoustics are unforgiving. For a Saturday morning breakfast/brunch you're going to want to sit outside. 

Our server showed up promptly after water had been brought out. He took our drink order and then disappeared. Another server came by to inform us that he was tied up somewhere, and then took our food orders. 

I had the simple breakfast, you can't possibly ruin something that has been a staple of breakfast joints since the dawn of dining, right? Wrong.

The eggs were dull and a bit stale, the country hash looked like Denny's frozen potatoes with a sprinkling of slimy undercooked onions and I'm guessing sweet peppers?? Would it kill you to at least season these sad little bastards? Then the bacon... For the love of God!! It's bacon, that crispy crimson breakfast boss that we all know and love... Why on earth would you serve it like ham!? It was undercooked and rubbery. I sent it back and it returned obviously fried in oil, still flaccid still sad. 

My girlfriend enjoyed her tea, the French Toast was unremarkable. 

I read through these reviews, I'm going to go out on a limb to call some BS... 

If the crowd here is static and the patrons are all of the same pedigree, I can assure you that there is no way they are capable of giving an honest review of honest food. This place was exceptionally pretentious, and failed to deliver.

If you've never had an honest down home meal, and you grew up north of river I can point you in the right direction. For breakfast you're going to want to stick to Frank's or the Blue Willow Cafe. If you just want to go to a Fox RC knockoff minus the talent, P&P is your place.

We chose a lazy Sunday morning to go for brunch. It was around 9 am. We went preparing to wait. We were pleasantly surprised to walk in and be seated right away.  We had a wonderful waiter (can't remember his name) we explained to him that it was our first time here and he took the time to explain everything to us. I ordered ""Return of the Mac"" . My husband had the chicken and French toast. I substituted potatoes for the Greek yogurt ( no extra charge :-)) I loved this breakfast! I could eat it everyday if there weren't other things that I can't wait to try here. I love that they have good veggie sausage as an option. My husband loved the chicken he said it was moist and the breading was good but didn't take away from the flavor of the chicken. He said the French toast was okay but could of used more sauce. I love that the manager goes by and checks on how things were. He was funny and we really enjoyed his personality. To top it off they sent us home with a blueberry scone ( free of charge ). We enjoyed it the next day with a cup of coffee. It was perfect. The restaurant did fill up by the time we left, but I can tell you it would be worth the wait.

After the hostess let us know that it would be a 45 minute wait we simply dealt with it and stood in the small waiting area just inside the entrance. We had a party of 5 and had no idea that this restaurant was unequipped to handle a party of more than 4. Long story short, we waited over an hour and fifteen minutes passed that initial 45 minutes. We could clearly see that the waiters and hostess were talking about us, which only added to my frustration. We stood and watched other parties sit down before us when they could have just put two table tops together. After we were finally ready to be seated they lead us back to a makeshift table that was still clearly dirty. I then demanded that we be seated in the booth that was appropriate and they accommodated us.

2339,151,1,5,3,1,3,"Prep is quite the scene.  The tagline on their website says ""Welcome to Prep & Pastry, where our food is locally sourced and our brunches have booze.""  This adequately sets your expectations when reserving a table here.

The drinks...

Everyone around us had drinks and I don't mean water.  Prep has an extensive selection of cocktails including the longest list of mimosas I think I've ever witnessed.  If you live in Tucson, make it a point to try them all!

Our first course was of course the House Bloody - served with a ""beer back"", a shot of coffee stout which can be sipped alongside the cocktail or mixed in.  I mixed it in and for me, it mellows the drink's strong flavor and is the most creative twist I have seen so far with this common brunch favorite.

Later on our server, Matt, offered a bourbon-based cocktail which is one of the best versions I've ever had.  So sweet and fizzy...more of a dessert than a drink.  It's not to be missed (sorry I don't remember the name of it).

For the food...

My wife had ""The Beni"" - Prep's take on eggs benedict but carefully arranged into a beautiful stack of asparagus, a poached egg, herbed cheese hollandaise and of course, pork belly - the trendy take on the usual Canadian bacon.  This dish screams ""FARM FRESH"".

I ordered the ""Steak and Egg Sandwich"" mostly because I am a big fan of arugula and I don't think I've ever had tri-tip for breakfast so in a sense - I popped that cherry.  Off my bucket list!  I normally do not eat bread - my feeble attempt to cut carbs but in retrospect I wish I had.  The jalepeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½o cheddar bialy is one of the hallmarks of this dish.

Both dishes came with fingerling breakfast potatoes.  I'm not sure how they make these but if you only eat one thing at Prep - make sure it's these potatoes!  Holy crap they are good.

Post-mortem...

Prep & Pastry wouldn't be true to it's name if it wasn't for their desserts.  Th""cronut"" shouldn't be missed (they call it a ""dossant"").  My favorite is the maple bacon version - almost a meal in itself!

Enjoy your visit to Prep.  The food, the service, the drinks and all the smiling faces should keep you (and me) coming back again and again.",31/12/2016 22:27

2373,2200,1,5,3,1,2,"Gourmet Breakfast taken to another level!  This place is amazing.  Great looking place with fantastic service, and unbeatable breakfast food.  First off if you want to carb up you have to get the S'mores french toast.  This French toast is not your normal puny slice of bread french toast.  Here at Prep & Pastry you get super thick brioche bread sliced which is warm and chewy.  Then you have chocolate syrup drizzle, with chunks of graham cracker with little marshmallow fluffs.  Nothing short but amazing.  The cool thing is that the french toast comes in a bowl so it keeps all your syrup from spilling over and keeps it all together.  I know I know I am simple minded but I thought that was cool because i have never seen that before.  Haha.  If you are looking for a nice little quick sugar rush and you want a donut you have to get there Bacon Maple Dossant.  Their Dossant is a croissant / donut combination they came up with.  It has the texture of on croissant which is flacky but has the light fluffy chewyness of a donut.  Then you add the sugar from the maple frosting then you get the salty from the chopped up bacon which complements nicely.  The next dossant you need to get is the S'mores dossant.  Same dossant base but with a chocolate, peanut butter/graham cracker, with toasted/charred marshmallow topping.  If you are in Tucson this has to be your number 1 breakfast place to go.  Prep yourself to eat some Pastries!

With the pancake tour, you can try all three. Tea is served in a cute little french press.  We also tried the pork belly eggs benedict and tri-tip sandwich on a homemade cheddar biscuit, and loved everything.  It's a great place for getting some sweet and some savory items and splitting.  

They have a cute little patio that was just a bit chilly on the day we went, but we got seated immediately instead of waiting 30 minutes because we were willing to sit outside.  There's a fountain outside.

Whether I sit down for a proper brunch or stop by to pick up a couple scones, P&P never lets me down. Beyond the phenomenal baked goods, each person who works at P&P is genuinely nice and incredibly professional. It's always a pleasure to interact with everyone there. :)

Arrive early because everyone wants to eat at P&P and the wait can be over an hour--but it's worth it--who wouldn't want to sip delicately flavored mimosas and munch tasty pastries in a well decorated, stylish, bright restaurant. Try it, you won't be disappointed. :)",4/5/2016 16:56

I explained what I has noted and she dismissed me completely and explained that it couldn't have happened.

People who lived in Tucson a few years know that there are places in a small town setting that you just can't get anywhere else. Prep n Pastry is one of those places. This cute brunch place will always be packed on weekends, as it aims to serve Tucson locals with the most modern twists on old breakfast classics while also serving savory and rich tasting foods. 

The first thought when you come into Prep n Pastry is how cute and rustic the feel is to the whole place. It literally looks like a wedding photo, with the wood pairing well with the rustic decor and home-y feel! The service is great every time, and if it's your first time here, the server can explain the menu, and what's the specials of the day! 

The food is fantastic and instagram worthy! The most delicious plate I've ever had is their breakfast poutine! It's so good that it's only served on weekends! It's a modern twist on a Canadian comfort food, but the rich cheese and the savory gravy is the best I've ever had.  There are so many other options to choose from as well as drinks! 

Overall, Prep n Pastry is the best brunch place in Tucson and one of the best brunch places I've ever experienced!

Tips
1) best things to order - Breakfast Poutine!!! It will change your life! 
2) order the maple bacon croughnut! A fusion between a croissant and a donut. 
3) get the fresh squeezed orange juice, there's free refills on it. I've never heard that anywhere ever in my life! 
4) be prepared to wait on the weekends. Don't worry there's some pretty good coffee inside 
5) try the biscuits and gravy! Their gravy is the best gravy I've ever tasted!",21/10/2017 4:20

2437,2259,1,3,0,0,0,Food is subpar. Service is slow and the waitress and waiters take too long to come back to our table. This happened the last two times we've gone. It could be because they assume they wont get tipped well or maybe they aren't good at multitasking. My mom asked for her eggs a specific way and the waiter told her they dont make eggs that way and gave her the complete opposite of what she wanted. My moms a manager of a breakfast place in Oro Valley. She knows about eggs especially because shes a kitchen manager. You need to retrain your employees better here.,24/10/2018 15:40
2438,2260,1,3,1,0,0,I've eaten here now  five times and with different  friends each time....so obviously I do like it but have a few suggestions. When you ask if the hash is homemade and the server says yes perhaps they should explain it's not the usual hash one is accustomed too. Then who wants to eat a grilled cheese so thick and totally covered in butter you can't taste anything else?  Then there is the noise level...Guys please you can put in some baffles in the ceiling to cut down on some noise ...really you do know you can barely have a conversation.

2458,2276,1,5,5,0,3,"We spent a weekend getaway in the lovely Tucson. Prep & Pastry was the last stop before our flight home, and we couldn't have asked for a better end to this memorable trip.

The restaurant was spacious, welcoming, neat and clean with the ""crunchy"" and somewhat industrial feel to it. It only opens for breakfast and brunch which is their specialty. 

The breakfast/brunch menu was impressive with nice variety and unique house items. The croissant donut bacon maple syrup was To Die For. The croissant flaky layers with crusty sugary donut texture complete with fresh savory bacon sweet maple syrup on top, need I say more? The out of the box concept of house Bloody Mary with local coffee stout is ingenious. It just became our new ritual for drinking Bloody Mary.

P&P deserves more than 5 stars in my book not only for the superb food quality and selection, but as a whole exceptional dining experience. The staff is energetic, attentive, friendly and most importantly, HAPPY. Everyone of them looks happy to work there and believes in their restaurant. Both our waitress and the manager checked on us several times during the meal to make sure we are ok. It creates a positive environment that you can tell all customers are delighted to be there.

We got engaged during that weekend. We mentioned our engagement when we were chatting with our cheerful waitress. Next thing we knew, unexpectedly, they sent over Rose champagnes on the house with her announcing the news. Then, even more unexpectedly, an amazing young couple across the restaurant picked up our bill. We were humbled, grateful and surprised by this whole unforgettable experience at P&P. 

I am writing this review not only for the quality of the restaurant itself (which deserves 5 stars rightfully), but also a personal thank you to P&P. It is a meaningful weekend for us, and P&P makes it even more eventful. P&P will always maintain a special place for us, and we will visit Tucson again just for them.",10/10/2016 14:07

SO fresh and flavorful and hearty and perfect - LOVED IT. The presentation was fantastic and the service was wonderful.

I went back to Yelp and found this gem. We arrived around 8:30am, greeted by a very kind server. Coffee was superb. My daughter had the French toast of the day which was a pound cake concoction with raspberry and lemon curd, she loved it! I ordered the Sammie with house made bacon and gigantic house made English muffin. The flavors were spot on! My mother had the basic breakfast with eggs, toast, and potatoes. The breakfast potatoes at Prep and Pastry are amazingly crunchy and tasteful. Of course we HAD to try the maple bacon ""cronut,"" and it was decent BUT the blueberry, cream croissant is TO DIE FOR! Don't pass up the pastries because they're so worth the calories. We are lucky to have stumbled across this place.

We had a few issues with our food, and the employees there did everything to fix those problems. My guess is we just had bad luck with this visit, but like I said the staff took complete care of us. This company genuinely cares about its guests, and I would recommend it to anyone.

The next part was the food. I was able to try a Monte Cristo for the first time ever and I loved every bite of it. You get a side of some jam to put on top and it makes the flavors so unique with the cheese they use and the breading they use sprinkled with powdered sugar. The hash is great too and I would recommend the hot sauce if you like it a little spicy (they give it to you on the side). I would also recommend the croissant styled donut topped with bacon.

Josh was our server.  He was attentive and invested in our satisfaction from our initial meeting until the end of our meal.  He made us feel as though we were his only guests.  

The atmosphere is inviting, beautiful and comfortable.  We were greeted pleasantly by everyone. 

We were very lucky to meet the owner, Nate, who was friendly, charming, and generous.  Here's the best part - he loves to satisfy everyone who visits his establishment.  It seems as though it is personal to him.  One minute with him and it is obvious he is passionate about his customers' experience.  He makes you feel like you are a friend and a guest in his home.

There were three in our party and we each chose different menu items after an enthusiastic review of each entree by our waiter. There were constant smiles through the meal.

I also took a few bites of the cinnamon churro and maple bacon doughsants (a mix of a doughnut and croissant)... wow! Maple and Bacon just go together like peanut butter and jelly. And then finally for my actual breakfast, I ordered the am relleno. I have mixed feelings about this plate but I think they are mostly good. The bites need to include the spicy relleno pepper or else the dish is a bit bland and I kind of wish the eggs were over sunny side up instead of baked. I think the runny egg would have complimented everything else in the dish.

this has been on my list to try so I made it an event...It was on a day that was not too hot and early.

While you wait there is a wonderful area to sit and sip coffee.
Depending on the time there is usually a long wait (well worth it)
We were a group of about 10. We loved the outside seating area.

Breakfasts are wonderful. I am a duck fan...so I had CAST IRON DUCK CONFIT...WOW is all I can say.
Others had the smoked salmon Beni,homemade granola, steak and egg sandwich and more.
Wonderful service from our servers.
I can tell you I will be back.There is a lot more to try.

We sat at the bar and the bartender was so awesome! She was sweet, chatty and makes a hell of a drink. We had their Bloody Mary and oh my gosh! They use peppers and garlic infused vodka they make and it adds a great kick without any hot sauce. 

The food was fantastic. The monte Cristo with pineapple jalapeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½o mascarpone was delicious but not a true monte Cristo as it's more of a stuffed French toast instead of fried. With it had more mascarpone on it! The omelet was fresh with great flavors as well. Their potatoes are amazing! It was savory and perfectly fried on a pan and just perfection itself.

To start, everyones drinks were unique and delicous. I opted for the watermelon mimosa, which was super refreshing!! I had a taste of the bloody mary which was fantastic (not typically tomato juice, the right amount of spice and complemented with bacon, cheese and other condiments). I had a bite of one of the cronuts (croissant-donuts) which was mind blowing. For my brunch, I choose something a little more savory. I chose the grilled cheese, which was filled with pesto, brie and mozzerella. YUM!! I was able to sub a side salad for the soup, which made it a little litter. The coolest part was the table side mimosa bar. We ordered 2 bottles of champagne and got plenty of juices to mix with (guava, blueberry, strawberry, watermelon etc).

Clear as mud? Good. To start off, the wait of 75 minutes is ridiculous. I don't think of myself as a particularly important person but damn, that's a long time to wait for a meal. Thank goodness they offer drinks while you wait. However, the waiting area is severely cramped and you sit by the window as other people inside the restaurant are looking at you. It's weird. They need to figure out their spacing better. And speaking of spacing, boy, do you sit close to each other at brunch. 
Okay, now that I'm done complaining, let's talk about the good. The Bloody Mary- was good. No complaints there. The berry mimosa (The Cure) was also delicious. The food- was okay. I had the duck confit hash and the duck was nice and soft, the raw spinach was sorely out of place, the mousse on top was sweet and went well with the duck, and the potatoes were greasy, greasy, greasy. I was turned off by how soggy they were with oil, I feel that if they were crispy, it would have been a better meal.

I went with my husband today on a friend's recommendation. I did my research beforehand and took advantage of Yelp's Waitlist from the comfort of my home. We arrived 2 minutes after the app's recommended arrival time with a 50% smaller party than requested and had no trouble with the host upon check in. In fact, she was very warm and welcoming. We were seated within 10 minutes and during the wait I spent my time observing staff (great hustle everyone!), the beautiful modern rustic decor, and that mouth watering pastry display. We were seated in the outdoor patio area equipped with misters and a roof top for maximum comfort from our desert sun. Our wait staff was very friendly and accommodating, especially when inquiring about ingredients that may trigger my allergies. It's always nerve wracking asking about this when eating out. You don't know if you're going to offend anyone or be taken seriously about something you have no control over. A special thank you to the kitchen staff for making my meal safe to eat! Our food arrived picture perfect. My husband ordered the Poblano Verde Beni, I had the Simple Breakfast and substituted the toast for fruit, and we ordered Biscuits and Gravy to share. I'm always unenthusiastic about ordering fruit in a restaurant because you typically end up with a bunch of bland melon & one berry. To my surprise, every single one of my favorite fruits were in this bowl! Blueberries, pineapple, banana, strawberries, and an orange slice. The roasted potatoes with sea salt and rosemary were incredible. They reminded me of my Italian grandmother's roasted potatoes. They were the right amount of crispy on the outside and piping hot and tender on the inside. I'm severely allergic to my husband's food, but he told me it was very delicious! The biscuits and gravy we shared were excellent too. My first bite of biscuit was a little on the dry side, so I drowned it in more gravy to soften it up. I tried a different biscuit on the plate and it was much softer than the first one I had. Overall, still an amazing dish and would definitely get it again. We were checked on by our wait staff and I'm assuming one of the managers. I let him know we were blown out of the water and it was our first visit to Prep & Pastry. He returned with a complimentary dossant to seal our inaugural experience with a balance of sweet and savory. We took it home as we were pretty stuffed from our adventure. I just took a bite and it took me back to my childhood at the Italian Faire in NJ (my home state) where I would order zeppolis! I have not had any flavor come close to that in my life until now.

I am not a fan of their pancakes and service was really slow on one busy Friday morning. Nobody's perfect.  The servers are all ""hipsters"" with skinny jeans and ankle boots.

There's a nice rustic feel when you walk in, with lots of light coming in. My eyes were immediately drawn to the pastries in the front case, and all of them looked amazing. They were giving small samples of their scones, and it was right mix of crumbly and moist.  My friend and I also shared. Cronut, which I havent had before, as I believe they're the only place that has Cronuts regularly on their menu. The mixture of a croissant-donut is something else, and it's topped with glaze and bacon. It's honestly worth coming here just for this. While we ate the pastries, my friend and I both drank tea, which were both recommended to us. 

They're only serving a small portion of their menu until they fully open on January 7th, but there was a nice mixture of breakfast and lunch. I ordered the grilled cheese, which had pesto, tomato, and a mixture of cheeses. It came with a cup of tomato soup and they complimented each other very well. It would be a perfect combo if we ever get any cold days.

I made a reservation on Yelp beforehand, and thank goodness we did. You know a place is most likely quality if there is a demand. We waited about 15 minutes, and that's not too bad considering the several groups seated and waiting to be seated. We dined there around 9:00 AM on Saturday morning. 

Customer service: 5/5
Excellent! Each individual working for prep and pastry loved greeting customers. Our waiter seemed like a sunny guy - genuinely happy to be there and loved interacting with customers. A+ service.

Food: 7/5
The eclectic yet high quality menu choices were a lovely surprise. This place does breakfast/brunch right - everything I tasted was absolutely wonderful. I ordered the sweet potato scramble, and the eggs on top were done perfectly and paired well with the sweet potato/corn mixture. And the herbed mousse?? Fughett about it. My mom ordered the monte cristo sandwich. Best monte cristo I've ever had. The sweet, strawberry compote on the side was a masterful component to the dish. I'm so obsessed.",20/5/2018 23:49

Even if it isn't cheap, p&p's breakfast idiosyncrasies (last time, I had a greyhound mimosa & a prickly pear doughssant) provide the best comfort breakfast I've had in Tucson. 

While the menu speaks for itself (c.f. the breakfast poutine, vegan hash), there's a certain kind of detail that makes p&p stand out: they serve Exo Roast coffee. It's not quite that I was expecting crappy diner coffee--it just wouldn't fit with the rest of the p&p atmosphere. But the coffee--that detail--seemed to top off the experience in a nutshell.

This eatery is new to the area since I last visited and it definitely classes the neighborhood up a bit. I enjoyed a great breakfast here recently. Word is that the lines can sometimes be long but we went early enough to be quickly seated for our meal. 

The food is all fresh with some of the classics like pancakes, as well as interesting dishes such as my bowl of diced sweet potatoes, with other yummy stuff and eggs on top. Very tasty. Another person in our group had eggs Benedict that came out looking like a picture and apparently tasted great too.  As an aside, the coffee is very good. Not that bitter Starbucks taste but, rather, a mild but strong enough brew to linger over. 

I love the casual but chic kind of look inside. I'm not sure how long this location has been open but everything looks so shiny clean that you'd think they were brand new. It's bright and sunny inside, with comfortable seating and homey touches like a giant chalkboard with signs and adages written out. 

One thing I always look for when I dine out is how the wait staff treat you, as well as how they treat each other. I really liked the friendly atmosphere that prevailed among wait staff and the fact that they genuinely seemed to enjoy their job. Our server was super friendly. At some point in the meal, another employee came by to say hello and ask if we were enjoying the meal. They seem to be able to strike the balance between showing solicitousness without being too in your face and overly hovering.

2806,2576,1,5,2,2,3,"It's pretty rare that I feel moved to write a review after going somewhere once.  Restaurants have good days and bad days and I don't want to judge on one experience.  Prep & Pastry, though?  I'll judge away.

I was visiting family in Tucson and adventuring out on my own for breakfast.  Like a good Yelper, I did my research and found a few places to try over my time in the desert.  For some reason, Prep & Pastry was on my radar but I wasn't overly excited about it.  The last morning I headed to Prep & Pastry thinking, ""It can't possibly be as good as the reviews"".

The parking lot was packed and I had to park by Chipotle -- probably a no-no, but I sure wasn't going to skip breakfast over a darn parking spot.  I had wanted to sit on the patio, but the hostess suggested the bar and, being in a bit of a rush, I settled.

As I perused the menu, I noticed the bartender running around like crazy and assumed he must be stressed.  But nope, he was super skilled and able to move flawlessly between taking orders, pouring drinks, and pausing to talk with diners.  He was *awesome* and turned his job into an art.

I'm always a bit worried as a vegetarian that options will be limited, but there were a ton of choices at Prep & Pastry, including two vegan ones.  I opted for the Green Chile French Toast and the bartender's eyes lit up as he said it was a good choice.  After sitting a few more minutes I decided a mimosa was perfectly respectable at 9:00AM and got a Prickly Pear mimosa.  

My meal was absolutely gorgeous.  And after taking a few bites, I decided it might very well be the best breakfast I've ever had.  It was the perfect balance of savory and sweet with a bit of tang from the lime crema and the eggs were cooked to perfection.  I'm a bit sad while typing this that I won't be having it again any time soon.

There are a ton of items on the menu that I'd love to try (there's a Prickly Pear Lemon PIE listed under entrees - breakfast pie!) and several items that are du jours, including a french toast and regular toast.  But honestly, I'd be hard-pressed not to order the Green Chile French Toast when I go back.  I found myself talking about it to family pretty much all day.  You know a meal is either terrible or amazing if you can't stop thinking about it and this one was beyond amazing.  

My stepbrother who has culinary training said he's been wanting to try Prep & Pastry but that it's always packed.  It looks like there's a solution and that there's an app that allows you to get ""in line"".  Hopefully he'll be able to check it out soon.

I couldn't resist ordering a pastry to go since I was staring at them all meal.  What I got was flaky, blueberry-filled puff pastry with a cream cheese spiral of frosting on top.  I shared it with my stepsister later in the day (I must love her a lot to be willing to share it) and I thought she was going to lick the plate.  I thought about it, too.  I appreciated that it was tasty and decadent without being overly sweet.

I really can't say enough good things and am pleased that the restaurant lived up to the hype.  I was able to walk out the door having had the best breakfast of my life, a mimosa, and dessert, all met with great service, for later for $22 pre-tip which felt totally reasonable.  I really can't wait 'til my next Tucson trip to go back.

In the meantime, please order the Green Chile French Toast for me.",5/3/2018 15:51

The only thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars this time is the noise.  The new place has a lot of hard surfaces and can be quite noisy at busy times. We were a party of 5, and could only talk to the person directly across or next to us without screaming. We were seated at a table near the front door, so it's possible that the noise would have been more manageable in other locations. Next time, I'll try to sit outside. 

My other minor quibble was that the use of the Nowait app was limited to parties of 4 and under, so we weren't able to use it for our party of 5. I am hoping that this was because of the recent opening since we'd used it for 5 at the old location.

But these are relatively minor and I highly recommend this place for a great brunch.",13/8/2019 21:39

Whether you're coming for one, two, or ten (okay, maybe not too many because this location isn't that big), this place will meet expectations. I feel confident in stating that EVERYTHING on the menu is superb, because ... I've tried them all. From starters, to main dishes, sides, pastries, and DRINKS ! My favorites have to be... the grilled cheese, cast iron duck confit (the portions are sometimes a littleee meager, but it's delicious regardless), and french toast. Just pick something though. You'll be fine. 

The only pain is the wait time. Depending on the day, there's surely to be a wait.

We started with their lemon and blueberry mimosas. As an extra birthday twist, they were out of champagne flutes and made ours a double with regular glasses. We got the monte cristo and pork belly eggs Benedict (""the Beni"") and LOVED them both. The eggs Benedict came on a herbed biscuit where you could taste each individual herb used. The monte cristo was served on French toast that would have been delicious on its own. Both came with potatoes that were not the usual bland hash browns, but roasted and smashed with flavor.

I don't know what happened to this place but ever since they moved to a bigger location and expanded to more locations the quality has gone down hill.

It was like a cake based french toast it was the best and unique to anywhere else. Now the French toast is just tasteless bread that taste more like overpriced frozen French toast sprinkled with cinnamon and given a fancy name to make it sound special, ""churro French toast"".

Over the past couple months, though, the overall quality of the food has declined, even as the menu has expanded and appears to be more innovative. Example: several dishes include biscuits, and the past two times I've had them, they were either held too long in a steam table or microwaved (I don't know why they were so bad). Another: P&P was one of the few places in Tucson that really knew how to prepare an omelette, but the last two I ordered were overcooked, mediocre. Notice that I always try a bad dish at least once more, in case it's just the kitchen having a down day. So, after four passable, not-so-great breakfasts, I'll only go back, when a friend really wants to give it a try. And then, I'll keep my fingers crossed.

2895,2646,1,2,0,0,0,"Sad. Prep & Pastry started out fabulous, but the last two times I've been there, the pork and turkey sausages were under-cooked, potatoes tasted more of old olive oil and the center of the biscuits--cold. And the redone seating was not thought through. Large table placed in a large alcove that doubles as a ""bandshell"" for table talk which gets inadvertently amplified out into the restaurant making it almost impossible to hear your table mates or the waiter. Two seater tables placed so close to each other that the waiter has to assume the child's pose to service either table.  And lastly, being told that payments take place at the table after waiting in line at the cash register-- which I guess is just part of the decor--not a place to make payment for food? Ah well.

2898,2649,1,5,8,8,8,"""This is my second review of Prep because my first, in all honesty, was boring. Here is the real deal...""

Oh Prep, my sweet and savory Prep, how I love you so. This gem serves a transcendent breakfast; a marvelous piece of Heaven. The Best in our Desert City.

This love affair started about a year ago; my wife and I were looking for something special for the day's first meal. We had been curious about this place-- good reviews whispered in our ears.

We entered this cozy establishment to be greeted by a friendly hostess who uttered the words we all want to hear, ""Sit anywhere you'd like"". The scents were a magical bloom of bacon and other fine meats, fresh bread, pastries and biscuits, gravy and butter.

A friendly server quickly greets us with water and a half carafe as back up; takes our drink order. For myself, always an Arnold Palmer; my wife, a spectacular looking Mimosa. The menu was quite a feat as everything sounded amazing. We chose a ""Steak"" and Egg Croissant and a Breakfast Sammie. So here's where it gets out of control.

This work of art arrives at the table. Scents of well-prepared, garlic infused beef fill my head. Layer upon layer of perfectly prepared items topped by this aioli...oh the aioli. Others say ""aioli"" this and ""aioli"" that; this almost hurt it was so... don't have words to describe.

My wife and I share everything; in this case I said to her before I took the first bite, ""Babe, I'm going to have to this whole thing"". She replied,"" It's OK I'm loving the Breakfast Sammie"". So I slowly demolished this masterpiece, enjoying each flavor and nuance.

I ordered this wonderfulness every time since (along with their sweet treats that I'll get to shortly).

______________

Jump to last Sunday...

My parents just fully moved to The Desert City; foodies as well. They could not wait to dine at this marvelous establishment after the words of praise from my wife and I. Also, they love Commoner & Co (same owners) but that's an upcoming review.

So now Prep is the ""goto"" breakfast spot, especially on the weekends; deservedly so. The trick now is using the Yelp Waiting List. From the comfort of your home you can gauge the wait time against your preferred dining time. For me, we wanted a table for 4 at noon and the wait was 96 minutes; so I got on the List at 10:44am with a check in of 11:55am. Waited until 12:15pm and we were seated.

This fine place has the feeling of a home away from home--even when busy. We were ushered to our table and it was perfect. My father uses a small wheelchair when dining out; my wife mentioned this upon check in and they delivered. Our server quickly comes to the table with water; she knows we've been waiting a little to get into Prep. Did I mention the service is ALWAYS phenomenal? She takes our drink orders; 3 key lime Mimosas with a graham powder rim and my Arnold Palmer. She asks me about food allergies at the table and proceeds to bring out this mind-blowing pastry; their last one! A divine cinnamon roll covered in pecans and this gooey, rich caramel sauce. We devoured within minutes while in a food trance.

On to the mains (apologies for the long review but I had to release some serious emotions about this place). My father and I ordered the Biscuits and Duck Fat Gravy with Fried Chicken, mom the Poblano Verde Beni with Carnitas, and my wife the All Hail The Omelette with Turkey Sausage. Everyone was thrilled with their dishes, but for me it started my second culinary bromance at Prep & Pastry.

The Biscuits and Gravy were exceptional; my father and I wanted extra gravy which was brought out by our server in about 30 seconds. But this Fried Chicken... oh my Lord. I don't like to curse in reviews but my first words out after tasting this crunchy jewel were ""Oh Sh*t"". I've had a lot of Fried Chicken around the country and this not only measures up to the Greats in the South but is the best in Arizona. Very crispy with a perfectly seasoned crust; supple chicken within. As excellent as the Biscuits and Gravy were, I was on another plain of existence with the Chicken. Wow!

We wrapped up Breakfast with a cup of coffee for the parents, my mother proclaiming that it was ""really, REALLY god"". That mean a lot coming from her. The bill contained Great Prices as usual.

Conclusion: Everything Prep & Pastry creates is top-notch. Must tries are the ""Steak"" and Egg Croissant, the Biscuits and Gravy or French Toast with Fried Chicken and any of their pastries or donuts to start--all spectacular!

2899,736,1,5,0,0,0,Was here for a baby shower and had great service! They gave us these adorable heart shaped donuts filled with strawberry creme. I dream about those things.,2/8/2019 16:07
2902,2652,1,2,3,2,1,"2 stars for the service, 0-1 stars for food.

I was honestly so disappointed with my visit because it DID NOT meet the expectations that comes along with 1,200 reviews and almost 5 stars on yelp. 

I don't know if I came on a bad day or if the food is always lacking, but I do know that I didn't have the same 4-5 Star experience that most people seem to have here.

I will give props to whoever curated the restaurant's menu because I believe that executed well, the food would be amazing. (It definitely wasn't amazing though) 

I ordered The Beni and was soooo excited since Benny's are my favorite breakfast food. I was even more interested in the fact that P&P's are made with cheddar biscuits and pork belly. Unfortunately, the cheddar biscuits tasted like an old/stale Red Lobster biscuit that dried out in the Arizona sun for 5 days and lost its flavor. (Sand) The biscuit was so dry that it crumbled apart whenever touched and would fall straight through my fork. However, I could get over the dry biscuit. The pork belly, the item that is supposed to be the star of the show, was a bust. When I think of pork belly, I think of a melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat that is just the right amount of fatty. Strike 2  I've never had tough, chewy pork belly before until I dined at Prep and Pastry.  I really struggled to eat the pork because it basically resembled rubber in my mouth. It didn't even taste like good rubber. I don't know how P&P cooks and seasons their meat, but it tasted like they didn't even bother. For $10, I guess I didn't lose that much money but I usually love eggs Benedict and my plate here at p&p was hard to eat. 


My friend was feeling light and ordered the house made granola. He was disappointed that for $6.5 they didn't even offer Greek yogurt, but said the granola was good. 

My friend also ordered the Maple Bacon donut. He said the frosting was great BUT the rest of the donut lacked in taste and texture. He only ate half of the donut because the dough itself was so dry. I tried a piece and I definitely could agree that the donut tasted a day or two past it's shelf-life. 


However, at this point I'm not sure if the pastries/bread items always taste stale or if we just came on a bad day.  

Once again, their menu looks so appealing and I'm a fan of the creative recipes but I just did not have a good experience. :(


(My other friend ordered the chef's Hanna's French toast and was told it was a red velvet special. When it showed up, it was definitely not red velvet and even more not edible. The ""toast"" was burnt and when we asked the server what the flavor of it was, they said they didn't know .)


*** great service because the restaurant comped my friends French toast and gave him a new order on the house. My friend had already posted a yelp photo of his French toast and the manager/owner introduced himself to us and thanked him for leaving a yelp review.",13/2/2018 22:57

Here were my wishes for this dish: if the menu says the dish has ""over easy eggs,"" then, while the eggs we over medium and tasty, they SHOULD have been over easy and had some juice. Also, if the menu describes the dish as having ""asparagus, spinach, corn and bell pepper,"" then to qualify as a part of the dish there should be more than two pierces of bell pepper and corn that have to be actively searched for, and the ""asparagus"" should be more than a few pencil eraser sized slices of the discarded portion of an asparagus. No spear. Not enough to claim it. 

However, the three thinly sliced pieces of leek and the few leaves of spinach perfectly added to the delicious flavor of the skin-on roasted sweet potato. 

Our waiter was very nice. He explained the days specials well. However the young lady who delivered our food clearly didn't know her restaurant's menu. When I questioned the over medium eggs, she said that's how the eggs came in that dish.

Sustenance eating is what I do at home, not what I expect from a restaurant with this much buzz.

The fresh veggie breakfast bowl with kale, quinoa, avocado, and poached eggs was light and refreshing.

My fiancï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, bless his heart, tried to like it by taking only bites with the chocolate icing but it still tasted wrong. Like, you would be super thirsty after 1 bite - wrong.

First off the food is on point and my server was perfect. But unfortunately the 3 hour wait to get our food when every other table received their food was ridiculous. Or the fact that they forgot to seat us but sadly overlooked by the manager in a blue polo today. Despite all that we still wanted to
Order another bottle of champagne but yet again disappointed when the manager himself forgot to put that order in. I'd say if I owned this place I would have to re evaluate the management as the excuse for all these mishaps was we just wanted you to enjoy your drinks more. And that we tried again because you were busy but again forget us. In a town where new restaurants are are in abundance I'd say that you really focus on the amazing wait staff and look again at your

I'm guessing this is common to have to wait since the waiting seats outside were kept cool with misters. It was a medium sized restaurant with a nice covetrd outdoor patio. Eclectic menu i had the Monte christo which had delicious pineapple mascarpone and nicely melted swiss. The side of fresh strawberry Jam didn't come outta any store bought jar. Putain with duck and extra crispy fries, classic french toast, burgers, breakfast sammie, biscuits and gravy made from duck renderings...i saw drinks ranging from orange juice to bloody marys to coffee ale to the classic mimosas. The menu gave you chances to try something new. The staff were exceptional! One person in our party was requesting a dish and the chef came out and listened too what she was requesting and explained that that dish was not always on the menu and even though he would make it for her unfortunately they didn't have the ingredients. My dish along with others that i tasted were off the delicious charts. They offered a few dessert items which we tried but were petty disappointed with.... didn't meet our expectations. One in our party disliked her dish because she doesn't care for duck and they didn't hesitate to replace her dish with anything else but she declined and they immediately said they will take it off our bill.

My cute carafe of half and half was never empty! These guys and gals rock. It is a rarity to see a local joint have over a thousand reviews and maintain such a high rating so I had to check it out. Yelpers did not disappoint once again. I camped out here for a conference call, enjoyed a hearty breakfast in a corner of the bar and no one gave me the stink eye.

The male servers might as well leggings as well as there jeans/joggers are just as tight.  The food was meh, not worth the hype and my wife felt sick after ordering the chicken and waffles.

To start, the service was excellent. The servers have a super comfortable, low-key vibe. They make you feel like ""hey welcome back! good to see you.""

Oh and speaking of the atmosphere...it very quaint and beautiful inside. I absolutely love it!

Now lets talk food and drink. My friends love their drinks (I actually haven't tried them) but their Mimosas are supposed to be great! You have lots of excellent choices. 

Now the food I have tried: The Pork Belly Eggs Benedict was great! Lots of great pork belly and a really yummy biscuit underneath it. With their namesake, the baking portion is amazing. Their french toast with the chicken and toast is my favorite. Their other french toasts are excellent as well.

After coming here today, I have to say that Prep & Pastry definitely lives up to the hype! Wait times can average about 45-60 minutes or even more. We never take it as a bad thing because we can see that this place is popular. The only issue that we came across was that the parking lot is not very big so it was extremely hard to find parking. We ended up looking for street parking in the nearby neighborhood. Although you can't make reservations here, you can use the Yelp waitlist on the app to put your name down. What's nice about using the Yelp waitlist is that you can check to see how many groups are ahead of you. That is definitely a nice feature. Once my fiancï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and I arrived to the restaurant, we checked in with the hostess at the front and only waited a few minutes till we got seated. 

As we were looking over the menu, our waitress immediately came by to introduce herself and take r first time, she gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. I ordered the Everything Croissant Sammie and my fiancï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ordered the Steak and Eggs Croissant. We wanted to try one of their popular dossants or stuffed brioche donut that I saw on Yelp; but unfortunately, they ran out. Our waitress apologized and told us that they don't have any more pastries because they sell out extremely fast especially in the morning. She did suggest that we try a half order of the Churro French toast if we wanted something sweet. Today's chef's choice was strawberries and dark chocolate. That completely sold us and we requested a half order to share with our savory meal. Once we placed our order, we were surprised how fast we got our food. We felt like we didn't wait long at all. We found our food to be extremely delicious and flavorful. Both our croissant sandwiches came with a side of potatoes that were well-seasoned and crispy. We also loved the Churro French toast. It wasn't too sweet and the cream that  amazing! It went so well with the strawberries and chocolate. In addition, our waitress was very nice and even checked on us from time to time.

Just wasn't up for sending my meal back. My husband had a nice omelette and was pleased with his breakfast. We split a chocolate Dossant, $4, and it was cold, dry and a very non-descript flavor and texture. Just can't put my finger on it....nor my mouth on it again as it was just not good.

The service was notably lacking. When the waiter came to take our order, I pointed out the thread, presumably from a kitchen towel or napkin, in my water and asked for a new glass. That request went ignored until I had to ask another server. The waiter also never offered a refill of coffee, although he did bring one when asked. It isn't so much that we wouldn't return. We would; after all the eggs were cooked properly and the vegetables we asked for instead of potatoes were decently prepared.

Crowded is an understatement, which bodes well for this local fave's continued success! Absolutely worth the wait! Plus, a variety of baked goods to take home! Yes!!! 

That said, the food was amazing. Brunch entrees sampled were: Lox Toast (it's a must - just more gourmet, fresh, and tasty than you can imagine); the Prep Omelette (the most buttery, creamy omelette ever!), Carnitas Benedict (yes, as delicious as it sounds), and Chef's French Toast (of the day - churro french toast with strawberries and chocolate - OMG!!!).  

Service was appropriate for the crowd and newness of the location. Not too slow, not too fast, but got the check at the perfect time. Another plus: they will box your leftovers for you (even when they are in the weeds/slammed). 

Amazing to have a much larger venue and still lines out the door (which is typical for 'new eats' in Tucson). But, with P&P it's more to do with the quality of the food and reputation. It's one of the most highly coveted, go-to brunch spots in town. Excellent food, beverages, service, atmosphere. 

They have a call ahead wait list via yelp app and on their website (links to yelp). And, how pray tell, they keep track of all us hangry Tucsonans on a Sunday, I have no idea. Parties are notified seating is ready via text to their phone, via the app. Plus, to pass the time, you can order a beverage from the bar and mill around as far as the outer patio entrance with your libation. 

It is a bit loud, due to the crowd and hardscape. They could use a mic system for announcing tables, etc. But they get by. Suggest you keep your sound on on your phone for your alert. And, there is not a lot of waiting area seating. Be prepared to stand a bit. 

Here are the pros, cons, and tips to make your experience as culinarily epic as possible:

- Food
- Beverages
- Above average service
- Misted patio seating
- Good indoor seating (while super busy, you're 'on top of' your neighboring diner)
- Separate bar
- Good temp control (not too hot, not too cold)
- Automated wait list via app 

CONS: 
- It's a bit noisy (crowded, hard scape) when super busy. Nothing they can do about that, so be aware
- Lots of hardscape (contributes to noise level)
- Long waits after 9 a.m. on a weekend (over an hour)
- No reservations (unknown if this is true for special events, weddings, parties - they may take them for such things - I don't know)
- Not enough parking (if you can imaging that given their new space)

TIPS: 
- You can park in the lot south of their location on Campbell at the businesses closed for the weekend (turn in just before/south of their building)
- Suggest you call 45 mins to 1 hour prior to arrival on weekends for waitlist
- Tip your server/bartender - 20% and then add $2 for good measure and good karma =)",2/7/2019 4:28

3210,2925,1,5,1,0,1,"THE go-to place in Tucson for brunch for us. When we make it, it is almost always busy, but it is also worth it. Fantastic Bloody Mary's, too. The cast iron duck is amazing, and is my usual order. But there's enough other stuff on the menu that I sometimes feel I need to branch out. Super glad that I did on one visit for the steak and egg sandwich, which was even better than it sounded. And the potatoes are perfect, with a super crunch on the outside and still some tenderness inside and spot-on flavor. I always double-check whether what I am thinking of ordering comes with potatoes. It's worth re-thinking (or adding a side) if it doesn't.

A few more suggestions to mention: the Beni's, the prep breakfast sammie, and the ""all hail the omelette"" were all delicious.

But onto the food.

I could have just eaten their dossants/cronuts and coffee alone.  Upon reading review after review, I knew that my morning had to start out with at some moist, buttery, and flakey pastry. Their coffee (from Exo!) served as the perfect complement.  Sadly, the judging eyes of my boyfriend compelled me to order ""real"" food.

I had the Veggie Beni(dict), while the BF had the grilled cheese.  Both were flavorful and filling. The real star of the table was the soup the came alongside the grilled cheese.  It was hot, chunky, galicky, and herby... great for dipping.

3236,2948,1,3,1,0,0,"I'm from LA, where we take our brunching very seriously.  When I recently moved to Tucson, many people told me that Prep & Pastry is AMAZING and will definitely impress me.  Sadly, it did not.  I ordered the cheeseburger, medium rare.  The good things about it are: the bun is amazing and the pickles are very good.  However, I wasn't thrilled with the actual meat patty.  It was cooked medium/medium well to start off.  I know that a lot of places will re-make your dish if it's not cooked to your liking.  My burger took a while to come out to start off with, so I didn't bother asking because I didn't have time to wait.  Second, the patty was smaller than the bun.  I had cut my burger in half.  The first half had good meat to bun ratio.  However, on the second half, I noticed that half of my bites had no meat because the patty was smaller than the bun - that's one of my big burger pet peeves.  The spring mix that was topped on the burger was a little soggy and did not add anything to the burger itself.  The fries were nice and crisp, but a little overly salty.

The mimosa that I had was great though!  I think it was blueberry and lemonade.  That and the hamburger bun were my favorite parts of the meal.

Would I try this place again?  I'd be willing to, but I wouldn't wait a long time.  I've tried eating here multiple times before, but I've never was willing to wait (the wait during peak brunch times could easily be 30-90 minutes, from what I hear).  However, on this day, I had gone at 7 AM right when they opened so there was no wait.  Based on my experience here, I would not wait for more than 15 minutes.  There were a lot of people there and it's very highly rated on Yelp, so I'm thinking that my experience was atypical.  I would not order the burger again though.",17/4/2017 3:56
3238,2714,1,4,1,1,2,"Loved the flavors in the sweet potato hash. And while I will be back, and I am giving the restaurant 4 stars, it is because I believe the food has the potential for 4 stars. 

Here were my wishes for this dish: if the menu says the dish has ""over easy eggs,"" then, while the eggs were over medium and tasty, they SHOULD have been over easy and had some juice. Also, if the menu describes the dish as having ""asparagus, spinach, corn and bell pepper,"" then to qualify as a part of the dish there should be more than two pierces of bell pepper and corn that have to be actively searched for, and the ""asparagus"" should be more than a few pencil eraser sized slices of the discarded portion of an asparagus. No spear. Not enough to claim it. 

However, the three thinly sliced pieces of leek and the few leaves of spinach perfectly added to the delicious flavor of the skin-on roasted sweet potato. 

Our waiter was very nice. He explained the days specials well. However the young lady who delivered our food clearly didn't know her restaurant's menu. When I questioned the over medium eggs, she said that's how the eggs came in that dish. When I informed her the description in the menu called for over easy eggs, she said she could take my meal back and have the eggs redone but that would mean cold hash or reheated hash with soggy spinach .... hmmmm...",17/2/2017 4:07

I had the Roasted Veggie Beni and it was good, but very different than any Eggs Benedict I've had before, as there were actual roasted vegetables on the english muffin, so there was definitely a crunch to the meal. However, it was still delicious and even better when paired with the potatoes, which were perfectly seasoned and tasty!

My favorite thing about this place however, was the ""dossants"" and other pastries they sell - between my friends and I, I was able to try 3 different pastries and they sure do live up to them calling this place ""Prep & Pastry!"" I will definitely be back, if only to grab some pastries to-go since the restaurant is usually very busy. I'd recommend going at quieter times, like on a weekday morning.",30/10/2019 15:03

I don't often have a whole day off with my husband that we can go somewhere for brunch.  Being the breakfast snob that I am, I tend to just make my own at home because it is a much higher quality than going out somewhere.

When I'm throwing down money for eggs, I want them to blow me away.

I've heard a lot of buzz about Prep & Pastry and have waited to visit-mainly because I wanted to see if they would stay consistent before heading over.  I've been part of the opening staff of two different restaurants so I know that sometimes the quality and care go down a few months after opening.  That is not the case with Prep & Pastry!

We started with a Screwdriver and a Cosmo Mimosa.  The bartender did a phenomenal job- the flavors were balanced and light but there was still enough of a punch to the drinks.  While we were waiting for our entrees we split a strawberry ginger dossant.  The texture was a little hard, but that can be attributed to the fact that we went around 11:30 so they weren't pulled right out of the fryer.  The icing was delicious though - the ginger sang through the sweetness of the sugar and lended a spiced element to something that could have been way oversweet.

My entree was the Veggie Beni, with a side of the potatoes.  The eggs were poached perfectly, and you could taste the freshness of each ingredient used.  I added some bacon to the Beni (they have excellent, thick cut bacon) and it was a good salt element to the very rich dish.  I did ask for some hot sauce to help cut down on the richness of the Beni - it was delicious but for myself, I like a bit of acidity on my eggs especially if there is any kind of cheese or hollandaise sauce on them.  The potatoes were well cooked and I enjoyed the addition of the red peppers to them.  The dish was so rich I ended up eating only half of it-but I don't eat huge portions in one sitting.

My husband had the poutine and holy moly that thing was even richer than my dish,  He loved it though.  The fries were obviously fresh cut and fried and the eggs were again perfectly cooked over easy.

The last thing we tried was the Spicy Bloody Mary.  This thing is a meal in itself.  It's rich and decadent and spicy and pretty much the most perfect bloody mary I've ever had.  This would be a ""Must Order"" while you're here.

Service was okay - it was very busy when we got there - they may have needed another server on the floor or a designated person for the pasty shop portion.  It annoyed my husband that we saw 3 couples seated ahead of us at tables even though we put our names on the waitlist before them. 

The restaurant is very cute inside and I love the decor.  The way the space is layed out it is pretty loud inside so I;d suggest going during the week when it;s going to be a little less crazy so the noise level will be lower.",1/9/2014 22:21

This time due to social distancing requirements we were seated outside. I ordered the prep omelet with potatoes and hubs got the basic breakfast. We also ordered a cinnamon roll with bourbon bacon. I enjoyed the omelet with spinach, goat cheese and avocado. The potatoes were really good and sort of unusual in their preparation (crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside). The bacon here is sort of candied which is a real surprising delight. The cinnamon roll is not like the average cinnamon roll. It's more like a pastry than the usual gummy mess that normally passes as a cinnamon roll. It's texture was really food and the icing was nice and but not overpowering or sweet. Also had cute candied bacon garnish. I would love to indulge more often here but $40 is a bit much for breakfast. Maybe for coffer and pastries someday.",11/6/2020 23:27

3339,3031,1,2,5,2,0,"Bring a sweater and earplugs if you're having lunch here. My friends and I shivered through a meal at Prep & Pastry, under blowing fans and ice cold air conditioning. I understand that the restaurant needs to keep the kitchen staff cool, but it comes at the expense of diners.

The hard surfaces in the building and close proximity of the tables made for a deafening meal. We were seated at a table and had to shout to hear each other. The noise made it impossible to have a conversation.

I had the All Hail The Omelette with turkey sausage, caramelized onions, muenster cheese, mushrooms & grape tomatoes, cilantro & parsley, which was kind of small considering all the ingredients. When we got home I had a bag of nuts to fill up.

I understand that they get very busy, however, waiting after being seated for 45+ minutes on multiple occasions to give an order without being noticed is almost inexcusable.

I also love they use lots (all?) local ingredients with inventive menu items. A lot of things on their brunch menu had ""duck fat gravy"" which doesn't sound very appetizing. However, I ordered the cheddar biscuits with sausage and duck fat gravy.
It arrived very cold. The temperature of things is not usually very important to me, but biscuits and gravy served less than room temperature was a bit too much. I asked for it to be warmed up a bit, but they completely remade it which was super nice of them. The second hot version was divine.
The trouble didn't stop there though, my mom's soup was insanely salty. When she mentioned it to me I was a bit confused, this was coming from a woman whose favorite food is potato chips. We both adore salt...this soup was inedible though. She asked for a side of toast instead, which came promptly with lots of butter and homemade grape jam/jelly.
I reallyyyy want to like this place, and I'll definitely give it another shot I think we just had an unlucky experience. They told us our meals were on the house, and apologized which made a huge difference to us. Will try again soon!",3/2/2014 17:22

3402,3086,1,5,1,0,1,"My husband and I decided to treat our 24 year old son to brunch last week for his birthday (which also happened to be our 25th wedding anniversary).
I mentioned this to our server and he offered to bring us a complimentary pastry.  We ended up waiting quite a while for our food, noticing that the table next to us (who arrived after us) got served their meals ahead of us.  Our server finally came by with the pastry he said he would get for us quite some time ago and mentioned that our food would be coming out soon.  We indulged in the pastry which was called Carmel Macchiato.  It was soooooo good and the 3 of us quickly devoured it.  We were craving another one so after we eventually got our food and finished eating, I asked our server to bring us another to take home.  He returned with 2 different pastries saying that there weren't any more of the Carmel Macchiato.  We were pretty disappointed but the other pastries compensated some.  Waited a bit longer before flagging down our server to request he bring us the check.  He nonchalantly told us we were taken care of.  We all looked at him and then each other in confusion.  Huh?  He then explained there was no need to pay...""your food was really late so we got you covered!""  How awesome is that???  Excellent customer service, P&P!",18/9/2019 3:59
3403,3087,1,3,2,0,0,"I've tried to go to P&P three times and each time the wait was well over an hour, so I skipped it.  Maybe it's the Tucsonan in me, but waiting an hour for breakfast is just silly...run down the street and get a tasty burrito and call it good. Finally, I visited on a week day and we managed to get a wait that was only about 25 minutes.  ONLY!  With this kind of popularity, I thought, the food has to be UNREAL!

Well - it was good.  I'd even say it was very good.  But it was certainly not wait-in-line-1-hour and forego the burrito down the street good.  I must place the caveat, as well, that we did not partake in the amazing selection of cocktails.  Maybe I'd have given another star for that.

I have an allergy to dairy and eggs, and there were almost no non-egg, non-dairy options.  I ended up with the pancakes (a little egg won't kill me) and a side of bacon.  The bacon was truly amazing - thick, crispy and flavorful.  The pancake had lightly fried margins.  My husband's eggs and toast were prepared exceptionally well and were obviously very fresh.  The coffee was thick, black and tasty.

However, our service was still slow and distracted, the room was noisy and I had to wonder whether the food was actually that good, or if the wait combined with the drive plus the anticipation we had before our order arrived must made us think it was that good.

If you're a breakfast/brunch lover, can do eggs and dairy and don't mind a wait as long as you can sip a cocktail - this might be just the right match for you.  For a ""feed me before I turn into swamp thing"" egg and cheese avoiding simpleton like myself, this place just didn't live up to the hype.",1/3/2017 0:18

We were greeted immediately and seated.  Since we had reviewed the menu online beforehand we didn't need much time to decide and ordered our breakfasts right away.  We tried both 'beni' meals.  One is the pork belly beni with a cheddar biscuit, cured pork belly and cheddar hollandaise.  The other was a salmon beni on a biscuit with a beet hollandaise.  The plates are on the smaller size with no sides of potatoes or anything that come with it, so while filling we'll know to order a side of fruit or something next time.  As for what we did get the presentation was simple and the food was delicious.  The pork belly was crisp, the salmon flaky and moist and the sauces were tasty.  So for the itty bitty bad news.  The pork belly beni only had a couple small pieces of belly and the beet hollandaise could've used more beet, the online menu differs from the actual menu so the duck confit hash we were looking forward to wasn't there, even so we were happy.  Now it was time for the check and this is what cemented the 5th star.  One of the owners - who had been our server the whole time - came over to drop off the check, introduced himself and without us having said anything explained and apologized sincerely for the delay in our food.  Yes there was a wait but nothing we felt we had to mention and we weren't in a rush but we were impressed!  And it didn't stop there, he gave us a free doughssant to try and it was great!!

3418,3098,1,3,0,0,0,"1)They have a rotating menu based on what is in season, so do NOT use previous pictures of menus to help you decide. Hopefully you 3 star readers will see this. 

2) The menu they have is very unique, but I'm not sure how they handle dietary restrictions and cross contamination. If you don't eat pork, just be aware while you have options, there are many pork dishes (including their bacon waffles). I'm not sure how they handle cross contamination due to the volume of pork items. It's def something I didn't ask but should have . 

3) They have veggie options such as bowls and of course pancakes and waffles. Their potatoes are amazing!! I had the Nutella waffle and my partner had a duck entree. My partner usually orders eggs and toast no matter where we go, so I was surprised that he ordered and enjoyed the duck so much

The pastries are irresistible and the dynamic flavor profiles make them very unique. They have plenty of health conscious items on the menu and also sweets to splurge on. Oh and don't neglect their cocktail menu (best mimosas in town) and the fact that they serve Exo coffee (one cup and you're good for the day!). The staff are so friendly.

2day I opted to dine @the Prep & Pastry on Campbell, formerly the home of Casa Valencia & b/4 that, Yoshimatsu. A trifle expensive @$13.50, but decadent was the cast iron duck confit. Kevin was my waiter & he was professional and friendly. Duck shallots, cabernet braised cheeries, a dollop of cherry goat cheese mousse & 2 perfectly prepared over easy eggs.

* i ordered the biscuit and gravy, it was pretty good. the best i've had so far! the meat and gravy was tasty while the biscuit balanced out the flavors
* ordered an iced tea, came in a huge tea infuser, loved it.

The wait wasn't terrible by any means but there were still seven parties ahead of us. Ian got the prep's burger which he enjoyed and I got the duck confit, which I less enjoyed. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype I was expecting. There weren't many pieces of duck in the duck confit and I found the dish to be much too greasy to eat at 1000 in the morning. Furthermore, the cherry mousse on top of the dish was especially off-putting. I couldn't get over how pink and artificial it looked and couldn't get myself to eat it. Although I didn't particularly enjoy my meal, I will definitely be back if I am ever in the neighborhood. First, the service was exceptional. It is clear that great service is one of their top priorities. I was especially impressed with how many workers were available, eager to make themselves helpful. Sies looked absolutely delicious! I sat at the bar and so spent my entire meal staring at these delectable pastries, but didn't get a chance to enjoy one- next time! Third, the coffee was very good. It's rare to go to a breakfast joint and have anything but burnt Folger's generic coffee that requires spoonfuls of sugar and milk. Exo coffee was delicious to have just black.",18/9/2017 4:01
3524,3186,1,5,4,0,1,"Absolutely phenomenal. We were visiting Tucson for 4 days and we came here 3 times. We were greeted with a beautiful bright and open seating area and an incredibly nice hostess. I saw some pastries in a glass case on my walk to the table and knew this was going to be good. I speak for all 3 times I've been here when I say the waitstaff are so friendly and helpful with making suggestions for the menu. 

All 3 things I ordered were delicious but my favorite was the green chile french toast, they absolutely nailed it. Everything they do though has pizazz. Even their most basic dishes have a flare to them, which I love. 

Another perk of coming three times was that I was also able to try three different drinks...vacation right? They have a lengthy cocktail menu of incredibly unique looking concoctions, as well as an entire list of different mimosas. They will still serve them on weekdays and not just weekend brunch...which is great for those vacationing where everyday is a weekend! I opted to try a few mimosas, and while all were excellent, my favorite was the rose lemon. Exceptional. 

Now the pastries...: Our first time there our sweet waiter brought us a tiramisu cronut on the house because we were new and WOW was it delicious (and also such a kind gesture). Definitely sold me on wanting to try more of their pastries. The next two times I took a pastry to go for later in the day...vacation right? I was able to try their earl grey scone and their stuffed apple brioche donut. They also change them daily so it's always a new surprise what they will have. My only complaint is that we still had another four days in a different part of Arizona and pastries wouldn't stay fresh enough for me to take home with me!

There is a lot of natural lighting (perfect for those foodie photos )They do not take reservations, but you are able to call ahead to save your spot in line.
The staff is always super friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. 
One of my go-to meals is the Cast Iron Duck Confit  The braised cherries are an excellent and essential pairing to the goat cheese. I also recommend getting their toast with jam. Their jam is home-made, and it's SOOOO GOOD! Trust me on this one.",18/7/2018 1:12

We ordered the Poblano Verde Beni - the biscuit was so hard we couldn't saw through it with a knife. The whole meal was tasteless - and that's saying something for a meal dripping in hollandaise. 

We also ordered the Monte Cristo - it was so UNDER cooked that the French toast was mushy, runny dough and the meal had standing grease in the plate and zero mascarpone.

We each ordered ""The Cure"" mimosa. It's suppose the be blueberry and lemon infused. Mine came out first - it was a pale pink with zero flavor other than champagne. When the second one arrived it was a very dark pinkish color with zero alcohol taste - basically fruit juice in a pretty glass. 

The water came out without ice or an offer for ice on a very hot day. We had to flag down staff anytime we needed anything and there was open tables inside and outside. They were too busy standing around talking to each other.

But this experience was THAT bad. My teenage daughter and I decided to try it and really wanted breakfast. It was super loud and seemed overly pretentious. The hostess wasn't very friendly and the guy ( i think he was the manager) seemed a little overbearing when telling us about the specials. We were then told they had just stopped serving breakfast. We took a look at the lunch menu and nothing really seemed appetizing to us at that time. We decided to leave quietly. As we were walking out the door the same (overbearing guy/manager) yells from across the room  ""Ladies, where are you going?"" The entire place basically went silent and looked at us. we were so embarrassed,  and just continued walking out the door. A few seconds later the same guy comes running toward us through the parking lot demanding to know why we were leaving. All I could think to say was I had an appointment and quickly got in my car.

I took another bite to give it a second chance, but I just couldn't eat it.  And I'm not the type to send food back, so it was pretty bad.   However, the restaurant handled it really well!  When the server came over and I told him about my salty food, without hesitation he offered to bring me something else (I ended up getting the French toast special of the day, which was pretty good).  The manager also came over and explained that they realized there was an issue with that batch of hollandaise and they were remaking it, so it made me feel better that they knew I wasn't just some crazy person who complains about her food and sends it back. LOL.  They also comp'ed my entrï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½assy thing to do when someone sends a meal back.  I appreciate that kind of response to an issue with my food.

3612,3256,1,3,0,0,0,"Greatly overhyped. The place does have a sweet vibe. However, the menu is very limited, and the portions are small. You are really likely to need two two dishes. I had the breakfast relleno and it was like half a meal. Does not come with any potatoes, beans, etc. on the side. Had to add a scone to just get something resembling a meal's worth of food.

What is the biggest limitation is NO ESPRESSO DRINKS. Huh? You know you won't get espresso at Country Kitchen or Cracker Barrel, but criminey, this place is yuppie joint (with prices to match), so what is this situation about no espresso machine???

When I'm in Tucson, I'd rather have breakfast at Le Buzz, or Beyond Bread. Two rather different styles, but both offer a lot more breakfast for you. Le Buzz has an even sweeter vibe than P&P (who wouldn't want to be in Paris?), and does serve (a great) latte. Beyond Bread may be a bit institutional in vibe, but has great food, wide choices, and very good prices. 

Maybe what pulls people into P&P is booze. They do apparently offer a big list of exotic mimosas, but for those of us who do not imbibe, this is no big plus. Apparently, this place is often badly crowded. We came at a time when only a few tables were seated, so we had no wait, yet the overall experience is nothing special.",5/9/2017 16:36

3618,3230,1,5,3,0,0,"An overdue review from my initial visit last mid-January but I have recently returned...

Following the Sun Run, our group (8) decided to check out P&P after others raved about the amazing pastries.  They have only been open for less than a week at this time and it was already clearly popular.  Unfortunately they were short-staffed but they were attentive to their guests.  We had a long wait outside and a very long wait for our food.  However, our awesome waiter (an owner and/or manager) checked on us frequently and even provided complimentary pastries.  I normally do not order scones but they were delicious and (I believe) all infused with tea.  I did have a hard time deciding from their menu, as too many unique breakfast, brunch and lunch items sounded very yummy.  Our waiter helped me narrow it down to their infamous grilled cheese and tomato bisque combo.  This was no ordinary grilled cheese - it was a grown up sandwich with arugula & pistachio pesto, mozzarella, brie...yum!  Everyone else enjoyed their food and if I did not live so far away, I would be back more frequently to try their other entrees.  Despite all the long waiting, they graciously covered about half of our bill.  Since then I have been telling other friends to check it out...just needed to return myself!

Yesterday, I was in the area after some early workouts and came up with the best decision I've made in a long while - to start a typical, hectic Monday by picking up coffee and pastries to-go.  It around 7:30am and customers were slowly trickiling in to sit down and eat (lucky ones that did not have to rush to work).  I went straight to the counter and saw just a few pastry selections in their display.  I was immediately greeted and informed that the chef had several other newly finished pastries that were available to order.  I narrowed the numerous choices down to two dossants (doughsants) - maple one with tiny bacon flakes (brought back lovely memories of Portland's Voodoo doughnuts) and another one with strawberry flakes.  Since the server was packing up my goodies in a large box, I decided it would be best to add a giant snicker doodle cookie.  To top off my order was perfect Exo coffee with almond milk (yay an establishment actually has almond milk as an option)!  I was very happy with the service and delicious food.  Versus a regular doughnut (which I enjoy on rare occasions), I loved the airiness and flakey bodies of these thick dossants so much better; plus, the frosting was not overwhelming and the ""sprinkles"" added the perfect taste.  I intend on rewarding myself with such visits again in the near future, including a nice sit down meal.",25/3/2014 23:13

The Beni. Pork belly Benedict. This visit was disappointing. Biscuit was almost not edible.  Depending on your taste, the potatoes were served along with the ""the bottom of the pan crumbs"". If like a lot of that you are in heaven. If you want just potatoes, well in this case there was both.

Roasted potatoes were a little too crunchy for me, but very flavorful. Loose leaf tea was French pressed to perfection. Would have given 5 stars but restroom needed attention. Not sure if the one stall in particular had not been cleaned the night before or if someone blew it up first thing this morning. Hard to overlook.

3744,3361,1,5,4,2,4,"Coming here for breakfast, on a weekday, in solid breakfast, not quite brunch, hours meant we didn't have to wait... to sit outside. I waited so long to eat here because it seems to never not be crowded. It was warm, but there is a canopy and later they turned on the misters. If anything, there were too many helpful people in service here. I'd like to think there was a delicate scuffle that ended in a tearful hug over refilling our coffees. But seriously: very pleasant and attentive service.

We tried a little bit of everything with our orders, it seems. I'm very glad we came in. The coffee deserves a mention. It is good. A little glass bottle of actual cream will accompany it. The sweet potato hash had tender leaves of bright, verdant spinach, leek slices, peppers, seasoned and melt-in-your-mouth soft sweet potato with eggs and an herb mousse that I stirred all in together for bites of cheesy, vegetal savoriness. Yum. I put some hot sauce on the dish because I really like it with sweet potato but both with and without were flavorful experiences.

The peach/mango monkey bread had cinnamon and sugar sweetening the intricate folds of the (big) knot of eggy, light dough with studs of fruit. Not overly peachy or mangoy but the bites interspersed to add a different taste. The variety of pastries our waitress read off made it hard to choose. Not only were there a ton of delicious sounding options, but they ran the gamut of tastes, as well.

My dad got the traditional benedict and gobbled the thing. The smashed prep potatoes straddled that crispy skin with soft, almost mashed insides in texture expertly, with a delightful mix of herbs and salt. The turkey sausage is in patties, chock full of herbs and spice and vegetable aromatics. It was pleasantly chewy and lean tasting without being dry.

While the a la carte menu ends up being pricey, the dishes themselves are reasonable in price, especially considering their freshness and the quality of ingredients and cooking.

So, drat, I guess I'll have to brave the crowds another morning.",6/7/2016 2:03

We tried the breakfast combo -- the potatoes were creamy and delicious and the bacon was was thick and wonderful. The chef special - horchata like waffles were rich and sweet.  Both were satisfying and tasty.  The loose leaf tea was a treat and was served in a press and the waiter made sure that it was pressed at just the right moment so as not to become bitter (it was a rose green tea).  The staff were very attentive and friendly.  We were checked on by numerous people throughout our experience.,17/10/2018 0:12

3759,3374,1,4,1,0,1,"This is probably visit number 5 and this place is still pretty darn cool. Having been a handful of times over a few years, I'd say that the experience overall is quite consistent. There are a few draw backs but overall, the quality and effort put into the experience more than make up for it.

We showed up around 1 PM which is essentially brunch-goer suicide but we  wanted a solid meal with a little booze to back it up.  So, we asked for a table for two and commenced the 30 minute wait. It was at this point I strongly considered McDonalds fries, Circle K beers and a Slim Jim, but I knew the Cast Iron Duck Confit would right all the wrongs of the world.  So, we headed to the waiting area near the bar and ordered a couple Thai Fighters.  I'm not kidding when I say that the quality of that drink instantly shaves 10 minutes off the wait. I ordered two!  When we were finally seated, it was a little annoying to see we had been waiting and there were lots of open seats as well as wait staff socializing instead of breaking their necks to get people seated. I guess when I'm taking 30 minutes out of my day just to wait, and it seems like people are taking their time, I feel like they're telling me they could care less whether or not I eat there.  But on to the food...

We ordered the Cast Iron Duck Confit and the Commoner Burger.  I wish I had more to say about the meal other than: Well. Done! Literally, not a single element on either plate that was out of place, everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly, and food was out in the time you'd typically expect a drink order to take.  Oh, and the skillet potatoes that came with the duck? Phenomenal.  I've not had everything on their menu but everything I have had, I would order again. And did I mention that the Thai Fighter is amazing? No joke, top 3 cocktails in Tucson. I'll bet on it.

The service at the table was pretty lame with not a lot of personality or personal touch but the tip reflected that so, not much reason to dwell on that here. Service at the bar on the other hand was top notch.  Overall, if I was an Executive Chef busting my butt to turn out the best dishes brunch has ever seen, I'd be pissed if the customer wasn't able to fully enjoy it because the wait time and service were frustrating. I think the host staff is a little burnt out from impatient patrons waiting for the better half of an hour to eat and it may be worth figuring out how to make the wait not suck so much.

I explained to the waitress I used to live there and wanted to take my friend to the best spots! She was great then at the end of the meal informed us she ordered us a desert. She made it seem as if it was a nice gesture on behalf of the restaurant so I thanked her as we waited for it. She brought out a small order of French toasted, it was delicious as well! BUT as we received the bill I realized she charged me for it. I find that strange as I never once asked for that, but also would've turned it down if I knew I would've been charged as we were both extremely full, and I felt rude turning down a nice gesture! I didn't make a fuss over it, it was only $5 but that being said, it is not a good practice as a restaurant. To future customers, if they offer you this as what seems like a gift, DO expect to pay.

The food was wonderful. It's easy to tell that everything is housemade and fresh out of the kitchen. I had the veggie eggs Beni and it was so delicious. There was an assortment of roasted veggies on top of a delicious English muffin and smothered in hollandaise sauce. It also came with a nice side of breakfast potatoes.

The servers around us were cleaning tables and not one of them asked us if we needed water or if the food was okay.

The breakfast menu ends at 11am, but they still keep a few breakfast items on the menu, including two types of pancakes to choose from. I had an unusually hard time choosing between several lunch items (tri-tip breakfast sandwich, duck confit, grilled cheese...they all sounded amazing!) and ordered the salmon ($13) with whipped parsnips and brussel sprouts, which my server recommended.

It had been a little while (ten minutes or so) since we ordered, and our server brought out some zucchini bread to munch on and apologized for the wait. The yumminess definitely made up for it. It was taking a little more time, and after about twenty or so minutes (I didn't keep track) of waiting to owner came to our table and apologized himself that it was taking so long. He was so charming and we got free tomato soup, so I'm glad we had to wait. I got to sample more food! After being a server myself for a couple years, I feel the way he handled a hectic, understaffed kitchen and hungry people was in good form. Points for that.

I ordered the salmon medium and it was well cooked and moist. The brussel sprouts were perfectly done and the parsnips made the meal so much more interesting.
My friend ordered the tri-tip dip, which was a great success and another ordered the grilled cheese, which he said he very much enjoyed.

My friend ordered the Oven Roasted Sweet Potato Hash, $12 for some shredded sweet potato and a few veggies mixed in with and egg on top... in a small bowl it might have been a cup of food.... no toast included with the hash bowl. 
I ordered the Simple Breakfast $7 which is: 2 eggs any style, Prep's potatoes, toast & jam.  I decided to add the homemade sausage $3.50  (half of what the Simple Breakfast cost). My plate came with cold potatoes ( but a very big serving of potatoes) and one piece of toast, yes one slice of toast. Every other place I have gone for breakfast gives you 2 slices of toast. The sausage was  tough and over seasoned with sage, and it was one patty, again every other place it is two patties. The one patty was only 3"" in diameter. I ordered coffee and my friend had water. Our bill with a tip was $30...... for breakfast!?!.  I can go to several places in town and have a filling hot breakfast for 2 people both having coffee with 2 slices of toast each and a fat omelette with home fries for under $20 including tip.... I see the lines waiting to get in to P&P and can not understand why so many people think this place is so good....needless to say I will not be going back nor will I recommend to family or friends.",14/10/2019 21:50

- go early, and be prepared to wait
- put your name on the list before you get there through Yelp!

It has a lower ceiling and fewer tables, which means it's much quieter. The outdoor patio is nice, but rather loud since it's next to Campbell.

Like the 'old' location (now August Rhodes), parking is in short supply. I've had to drop off a family member who uses a cane and park along the street in the neighborhood behind the restaurant. Once or twice, I've been lucky enough to get a spot in the lot. In spite of the crazy parking situation, wait times typically are not long. You also can add yourself to the waitlist electronically.

Once you try a few menu items here, you'll understand why Prep & Pastry is so popular. For breakfast, my partner gets the Poblano Verde Beni or Green Chile French Toast. I get the Green Chile French Toast or Avo & Herb Toast. For lunch, my partner gets the Cubano, and I get the Seared Salmon. The flavors are fantastic and fresh. Yum!

Prep & Pastry also has a large selection of non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. I usually get peppermint tea, but have ordered The Cure (mimosa) on special occasions. We occasionally get a pastry to take home for dessert, as well. There's always a good selection.

Duck confit  (kinda like a corned beef hash) with sour cherries you know the ones you put in fancy drinks, breakfast potatoes, over medium egg and wilted spinach. The tartness of the cherries really did it for me.

3953,3536,1,2,0,0,0,"When I first ate at this restaurant at its original location in Tucson, I wasn't disappointed. The food was top-notch, both in terms of it's quality and presentation. 

It had been a few years since I had eaten there, and now after trying it three more times, I must say, something must have went terrible wrong. 
Maybe it was bad luck? The wrong day(s)? I really hate leaving bad reviews. 

I'm a cook, so maybe my expectations are different from that of other customers. Regardless, I am not a picky-eater. I can usually appreciate the good in most restaurant's food for what it is, even if it's not that great. 

But as previously mentioned, the last THREE times I have eaten here, the food was almost grotesquely inedible. The last time I ate here, my girlfriend, who loves breakfast/brunch foods, ordered some kind of hash with lots of veggies, and I had a tri-tip sandwich with pesto/chimichurri (?). The hash was uttlerly disgusting. It was served stone-cold, the potatoes were soggy, and everything tasted like it was smeared in duck fat. She offered me some and I gagged. I felt so bad. My sandwich was at least edible, but had almost zero flavor. The steak was rubbery and didn't taste like it was seasoned at all, and the bread it was served on, which was basically two pieces of sandwich white bread, wasn't robust enough to hold together the sandwich. Flimsy, wet, soggy white bread. 

I'm sure that the food isn't usually this bad. But even regardless, I really do not understand the hype over this restaurant. The menu is boring, generic white-people brunch food, nothing special. Eggs, potato, avocado, bacon. Stodgy and uninspired, yet overpriced. No thanks.",17/2/2021 20:59

The drinks are phenomenal, the prickly pear mimosa was the right ratio of juice:champagne and the bloody Mary's were to die for! They were even able to make virgin bloody Mary's and included a glass of cold coffee instead of the beer back normally provided.

I assumed this was a safe choice, but damn, I could not have been more wrong.  I got the Return of the Mac ($11.50) and my partner got The Beni ($12.00).  I swapped the acai yogurt for an English muffin.  This was one of the most pathetic meals I have had in a long time.  Return of the Mac: The amount of eggs was so tiny and they were completely unseasoned.  It was probably the egg whites of 2 eggs at the most. They were mixed in with spinach that never got cooked so it was basically a salad of raw spinach with some egg whites mixed in.  The menu description says ""sliced tomatoes"" but I never expected to get an out of season diced roma tomato. If you know how a hard off-season tomato tastes...this was worse. I guess I got what I ordered, but why even serve something so awful?  The English muffin was so tough and overly chewy I had to rip it apart.  It came with ""strawberry jam"" which was about ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a ramekin of stewed strawberries.  It was not jam.  I tried my partner's Beni and it was slightly better.  I wasn't impressed by the biscuit or the sauce, but the egg was cooked well.  The side was potatoes which came in a tiny bowl.  They weren't grilled, but more like boiled, then cut into quarters.  It was odd.  We already had coffee, so we only ordered waters, and the bill was still over $30.  I ate so little of Return of the Mac that I was still hungry and we stopped at McDonalds on the way back to the hotel which is something I have NEVER done before.

It used to come with the syrup. I used to love, I mean looooove their Maple bacon. They now add huge black pepper to their bacon. I asked for no pepper and I got a regular bacon, not a maple one. If they would've told me they couldn't take off the pepper from their Maple bacon, I would have not ordered any bacon. On top of this, they stopped serving cold brew!!! And, they used to have coffee while waiting for a table, nope that's gone, too. In addition, we waited over 30 mins for our mediocre food. 

The food quality and how long it took to get the food would've earned them two stars. Their waiter, however, was kind and comp the bill. We gave him a decent tip for making the experience less unpleasant. And for that, Prep & Pastry got another star, making it three stars.",28/7/2019 17:00

My first review left off with me saying that my husband was jealous that my young daughter and I came without him after we raved about it. So we finally brought him and my older daughter for brunch. French Toast and the Grilled Cheese (darn tasty tomato bisque) were awesome. Tri-Tip Sliders so far, is the only dish that we were not crazy about (yes, we get dishes to swap/trade/sample). The tri-tip was a little too dry and the cheddar biscuit was unable to hold up as a slider.  But the Breakfast Poutine...oh wow. That is a dish that is sinfully amazing. Pork belly and the duck fat gravy will send you into cardiac arrest for more than one reason. 
Went back for another visit today (this time with a much bigger party who had never been) and we were delighted how quickly they accommodated us. This time we were able to try several more dishes and each one was stellar. The Veggi Beni (my 8 year old made it very difficult to share bites as she was loving every bit of such an innovative dish) and the Cubano were the highlights of today's visit.  
This review would not be complete without the mention of the recently added liquor options. I love my booze, but I'm not crazy about beer or tomatoes. So I found it rather interesting that I kept stealing sips of my husband's Bloody Mary (made with garlic infused vodka) and served with a coffee pressed beer back. Even the sample of the Iron Jack beer that we got to try was quite tasty.  The Old Fashioned Mimosa was delightful as well.  
Special thanks to Nathan who always seems to be around checking on his guests and ensuring that everyone is well fed and content. Definitely makes our patronage feel appreciated. 
So my problem?? Well seems that my first visit has turned me into an addict. Will be seeking treatment soon. But only after a few more visits to Prep & Pastry.",6/7/2014 2:40

I went down to Tucson to see my dad. The first thing he says, ""Have you tried the new-ish Prep & Pastry? Of course you haven't. Let's go!""

By now, you should probably know, almost as well as I do, that if my dad is suggesting it, that this place is going to have all sorts of history, be super hip and have great food.

Cut to: I'm chauffeuring my dad as we drive down Campbell, which has been under construction since I was in high school, and my dad says, ""Turn left here. No! Here! No! Here!"" And we turned on to a little side street off Campbell, called Hedrick Avenue, and parked. Hedrick Avenue was full of potholes, but not under construction, and across the street was Prep & Pastry.

THE STORY 

We walked in to a room, divided into two, with high ceilings, wood beams and stained concrete. There was a small wood podium. At the podium were two early 20's, adorable people: a man and a woman. The woman asked if we had reservations and said it would be a few minutes and then continued whispering to the young man. They both seemed not to notice they were at work and did little to help speed along the process or to see if they could make people more comfortable. There wasn't much room to stand, and it got uncomfortable as it got busier as people were crowed and the overflow pushed out to the parking lot.

A few minutes turned into 20-30 minutes. I kept joking with my dad that I would be reporting this waiting mess on social media and my dad just politely smiled his, ""oh you kids and that social media stuff"" smile.

We were finally seated and the rest was very smooth. We ordered drinks; a berry mimosa and an Arnold Palmer and breakfast; eggs Benedict and Crab Melt. (see pics) Everything was terrific!

Of course I had to hear the story of this restaurant.

The only downfall was that the potatoes were way too crispy. When I went to the old location the potatoes were cooked just right and downright delicious. I ordered the Monte Christo like always and love that it's paired with a sweet jam to dip my breakfast sandwich in.

We decided to arrive at 9:30 anticipating at least a half hour wait.  When parties that arrived after us kept getting seated, we began to get antsy and checked on our status a few times.  About 45 minutes later, we were finally seated and shortly after, Will, one of the owners, came to our table with apologies for our long wait and a complimentary assortment of pastries.  This was exactly what we needed to get back on good terms and shows that the owners of Prep & Pastry genuinely want to provide good customer service.

About the food: the pastry selections were all good but the maple bacon dossant was by far the winner.  Our 3 teenagers (2 of who were celebrating their birthdays) all enjoyed their orders: Chef Omelet, Tri-Tip Sliders and Biscuit and Gravy. I ordered and enjoyed the Duck Confit Hash - although I will say that it was a bit on the sweet side, so if you're not real big on sweets, you may want to choose something else.  We also ordered a couple of The Beni's and a Simple Breakfast.  The toast that came with the Simple Breakfast was pretty hard but once we alerted our server, she brought a replacement.  

No complaints on the service - our food was received in a timely manner and our server was pretty attentive to our needs.

Today we went in and ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of scrambled eggs, and the plain pancakes with a side of bacon. The biscuits and gravy were delicious, but unfortunately very dry. I would've preferred if they used 3 to 4 times the volume of gravy that they did. For two large biscuits they probably put about a third of a cup of gravy on there. Therefore most of the bites had only a tiny trace of gravy. I'm used to having my biscuits a little more heavily drenched in gravy (like the biscuits and gravy at Sunnyside Up Cafe - not is fancy but can't be beat!). As a result, we were only able to eat half the plate unfortunately because it was just too dry. Regardless, the flavors were all there. The scrambled eggs were rich and moist, probably some of the best restaurant scrambled eggs I've ever had. Same with the bacon. Cooked perfectly, very thick, very flavorful. Again, the best restaurant bacon I've ever had! The pancakes were a decent and had a subtle vanilla flavor...but also very dry because for a stack of three pancakes we probably only got about three tablespoons of syrup. As far as the service goes, our server was super friendly and efficient. We will be back but I will be asking for extra gravy and syrup next time!",11/3/2017 20:48

We ended up seated on the patio, where the service was excellent. The brunch menu has the stuff you expect (granola, bacon and eggs, etc.) and the stuff that makes this place special: breakfast poutine, duck confit hash, and a pork belly breakfast sandwich that could become an obsession.  We had a great time tasting each other's selections and everyone agreed to make Prep & Pastry part of their regular breakfast/brunch routine --- can't wait to go back and try those eggs beni!",24/9/2015 3:42
4168,3714,1,5,1,0,2,"What a delightful breakfast! So pleasant. Breakfast was delicious. Here's a tip if you are going on a holiday or on the weekend: Get there before 9:00 or you will be waiting in line for a table. Just wake up a little earlier. Of course, here on Yelp, it shows the typical busy times and the wait times. A pretty cool feature of the app.

My wife and I came here for Veteran's Day. Beautiful day, so we opted to eat outside on the patio. I'm impressed by how much space there is compared to their last location. Must be three times the seating. And there still was no parking in their lot, on the street, and the neighboring businesses' lots were filling up. Good thing those businesses are closed on the weekends.

My wife had the ""All Hail the Omelette"" and I had the Monte Cristo. There were way too many scrumptious choices on the menu and it was difficult narrowing it down. Guess I'll have to visit again and again.

My wife really enjoyed the omelette. She said that the flavors did not overwhelm each other and were nicely balanced. She also ordered a fresh fruit cup which came with pineapple, strawberries, and blueberries. Surprised it cost only a buck. The strawberries (they were also a garnish on my Monte Cristo) were the first strawberries we've had since leaving SoCal that actually tasted like strawberries and were sweet.

My Monte Cristo was satisfying. It is supposed to be made with a pineapple marscapone, but I didn't taste the pineapple that much. But it was still a good balance of flavors, nothing overwhelming each other. It comes with a fresh strawberry preserve, but I also asked for honey.

I ordered two eggs, over medium. This is the second time I've asked for it here, but they failed. Got it over easy again. Over medium is cooked longer than over easy, but not as long as over hard. The yolk should be slightly set, but creamy and not runny. 

I also had a stuffed brioche donut. Excellent. The texture was perfect. Yeasty enough to be light and fluffy and not thick. The filling was a perfect custard with a fruit flavoring. 

Great food, excellent service, nice ambiance. 

5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.

4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.

3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.

2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money.

1* = How are they still in business? Stay away at all costs!",13/11/2019 22:24

The chicken and French toast is so good - chicken was so tender and not dry at all. French toast was surprisingly tasty with how savory they were with the rosemary! 

I've also had the pork belly Benedict - really good, but super fatty/rich, so just be prepared for that. I might get it with fruit instead of potatoes if i was being smart. ;) 

The iced black tea is good here - has some floral notes that make it almost taste like a passion tea, but it's not sweet!

Matt & Kevin (hey guys!) were extremely welcoming and accommodating. Seeing as it was our first visit, we sought out some recommendations. My partner settled on the Chicken & Toast (fried chicken, rosemary brioche french toast, blueberry reduction) and I on the Monte Cristo (griddled french toast, ham, pineapple marscapone, and melty cheese). Per the staff rec, I added an over easy egg to the MC sandwich AND opted for a little side of hollendaise to dip. OFF. THE. CHAIN. He called this the ""bougie"" version; totally worth it.

Cold brew is delicious and unlimited (EXO Coffee Roasters) and the drink menu is diverse. We were both offered ""to go"" cups of our beverages if we chose. 

Didn't get to partake in any of the pastries, as we were totally stuffed from our meals. However, they're beautiful and I am 100% positive they're delicious, too.

Love, love the decor and feel of the place. Very open and simple. Service (by Allie) was very friendly and efficient. 
We ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast. I almost regretted ordering it as I was afraid it was going to be too sweet but was pleasantly surprised to find that was not at all the case. Only thing that could have made it a little more perfect was if a few banana slices would have been thrown on top.  We also had the Simple Breakfast w/o eggs.  Well technically, my little one ordered all the sides that would have made up the Simple Breakfast. Bacon, hash and toast. Bacon was delicious (maybe a little too fatty, but it is bacon after all). Hash and unbuttered toast (that jam was wonderful) were great too.

I also tried the french toast with berry compote which wasn't bad.  The biscuits and gravy was definitely decent.  I'd highly recommend trying something new here since they're obviously more of a creative food place, and they're actually good at it!

4280,3234,1,4,1,1,1,"Came here on a Sunday for lunch and had a mixed experience.

The Good:
Pleasant, BoHo atmosphere with exposed beams and rustic features throughout.  Employees echoed that same vibe and it was all relaxing and inviting.
Food was reasonably priced (I'll dub it: upscale cafï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ at $10-13 per entre) and service was attentive despite there not being a single open seat anywhere.
We sampled four different entrees - The Good:  The duck confit; steak and egg sandwich; commoner burger - were all terrific... substantial in serving size; warm upon delivery; and flavorful as described.  The burger was huge (two beef patties!).  The potatoes that were served on the side were also very good (fresh cut and skillet-browned).  I rarely eat fried potatoes no matter where I am (carbs) but these were nicely seasoned, crisp-yet-tender.  I did request a different option to the potatoes but was not offered any alternative by our waitress - that needs to change (unless she misunderstood?).


The Not-So-Good:
The wait wahr 15min and it turned out to be 1hr 10min.  The accuracy was remarkable, however, I'm posting this in the ""not-so-good"" because you shouldn't be artificially optimistic. The wknd waits are extremely long. Always. And they do not take reservations for any size, for any reason. I think that is unnecessary. It permits a restaurant to operate at peak efficiency with little logistical effort, but it's so unmindful of a large group of customers who cannot (physically or logistically) stand around for 70-80 minutes.
Fourth Entre: the Monte Cristo - Not So Good.  This was small, in relation to the cost/size of the other three entrees and it had almost no ham (a tiny lump, concentrated in the center of the slabs of French toast).  It was stunningly disappointing, in comparison to the other three entrees too.  The outside of the Monte Cristo was not crisp either, something that is special/unique to this batter-dipped, deep-fried specialty.
Most of us had coffee. While refills had to be requested on several occasions (rather than proactively observed by our waitresses) they did return fairly quickly with the coffee. However, all of the refills (served from a liter-sized thermos) were luke-warm at best.  That was a big bummer. This was especially true of the third/last refill which we'd requested as decaf... it was almost cold.

Parking can be a challenge, with the lot typically full. However, there are another 8-10 spots on the adjacent side street that meets all the requisite parking needs for this establishment.",26/2/2018 22:31

I've eaten a lot of breakfasts in my day and at a lot of different restaurants and I had a Top 5 that I thought would never be cracked. Prep & Pastry blew them out of the water.

It being a newer place, I didn't have any expectations, just wanted to check it out and it was next level. I ordered the Breakfast Putine, while my friend ordered the Fried Chicken and French Toast. I let them have the first bite and vice versa and I'm glad I did because after I tried the Putine, I wasn't sharing another bite. Both dishes were delicious and I happily cleaned my plate.

I will definitely be back. Can't wait to try more of the menu. 
The owner and wait staff were both very friendly and you can tell they are excited about the future of the restaurant, which they should be. Prices were very reasonable and the portions were just right. My new favorite breakfast place.",25/2/2014 5:19

This bowl was delicious, nutritious, and fueled me for the day. I appreciated the presentation details, like the dash of maldon's salt across my avocado. My dad got the steak & egg sandwich, which I sneaked a bite of, and it was also delicious. The sourdough bread alone was to die for.

4319,3839,1,4,15,9,10,"Ever since I heard I could get cronuts in Tucson here, I had a singular focus, go to Prep and Pastry and get my hands on one. My first visit, I spotted spotted them and just fantasized how it would taste while waiting to be seated; it was a maple bacon variety and I was torn what to do as I like bacon but not so much on any old thing. They have pork or pork belly on several of their menu offering. It is THE ingredient to have for many modern eateries lately. The front area, has a nice display of fresh pastries that make me want to order everything and throw my diet out the window. Lucky for me it was lunch and the two left were snapped up. 
In the mean time, I enjoyed a wonderful beet salad inside their open airy restaurant.  My friend ordered their tri tip sandwich and was unable to eat it since it was too fatty for her. So my next adventure to Prep and Pastry was for breakfast. This time I was able to order a cinnamon sugar cronut , which they call a doughsant. So if you too are on the same mission let me tell you I believe there is a difference. For one, the cronut I did have, had pastry cream. Their doughsants have icing on top and no cream or custard associated with it. My husband commented that it tasted like a churro; which for $4 bucks you can decide if you would like a tall doughnut shaped churro textured pastry. It's yummy but not croissant tasting.  I think adding the pastry cream would make it another level of wonderful.
For breakfast I have enjoyed their AM relleno, which is a roasted chile topped with a cooked egg and cheese mix, all on top of red spicy mole sauce( which comes from the Native Seed store). I loved the flavor profiles of this dish and it was a moderate portion of food; perfect for me. I've also tried their corn beef hash, which as much as I usually love corned beef, was a bit disappointing. The gnocchi that is served with it was out of this world fantastic!

They serve Exo coffee, which is roasted on 6th Street in downtown Tucson. WIN!

I was lucky enough to be offered a sample of their new brioche chocolate chip french toast. It was served with a citrus whipped cream and maple syrup. I loved all three, but I would prefer vanilla or regular whipped cream with the chocolate chip bread. I think the citrus whipped cream would be excellent on a blueberry french toast, but that's just my two cents. The parking is a bit tricky since word of mouth is spreading and there was no parking in the lot my third visit and I had to park on the street. During the week, when it's not crowded it's a wonderful place to dine. When it's crowded it gets noisy fast. Also I would like to add, every trip I have had EXCELLENT service from the staff. Which makes all the difference.",9/2/2014 22:46

The entry is small and everyone was crowded. I had no idea what was going on but apparently you have to order at a plexiglass window and then wait. We wanted to be seated but nobody explained anything to us but did manage to yell for everyone to socially distance. Which is impossible at this location. So after 15 minutes, we left and so did the party of 6 behind us. Very confusing setup and no acknowledgement. Disappointed.

Boy oh boy. This place always has fantastic service and the food is delicious. My favorite recent bite was the eggs and bacon toast. It was one of the best breakfasts I've had. It's usually pretty busy when we get there, but never a long wait. High recommend",3/9/2020 21:02

Service is consistently phenomenal. Especially Bo. As someone in the industry, you know when a server really cares versus when they're just going through the motions. Bo knows brunch. Not only can he speak to the fantastic rotating seasonal specials, he knows the menu inside and out and gives honest, fail safe recommendations.

So get ready to wait if you are planning to go here during prime brunch hours. I was able to get a table without a wait on my second visit, at 7:30am on a Tuesday. We were able to bring our dog into the patio and since it was winter, the staff lit up two outdoor lamps to keep us comfortable. I can't remember the exact names of the items we ordered, but we had the French toast sandwich, omelette, eggs benedict and a simple egg and bacon breakfast. Everything tasted delicious and we were surprised at the amount of flavor in what seemed to be simple breakfast items.

4345,3862,1,5,4,1,3,"There is nothing like a good brunch with mom. While running errands with my mom we decided that mimosas were in order. She recommended Prep and Pastry.

Our only regret was that we didn't have a designated driver so we could enjoy more mimosas. What a cute and welcoming restaurant. Clearn lines, high ceilings and friendly staff all made for a wonderful first impression. 

We only had a short wait on a Sunday morning for a table. We perused the unique and enticing menu. All of your brunch standards with some exciting twists. We opted for the regular Beni (though with pork belly instead of bacon) and the Cast Iron Duck Confit. When we explained we were sharing these entrees and asked for a plate on the side, our server without missing a beat, offered to split our orders right from the kitchen. What a wonderful touch of customer service!

The Duck Confit Skillet was very tasty- delicious duck sausage, a perfectly poached egg, cherries and cherry sauce with spinach and super yummy crunchy potatoes. Not quite what I was expecting, but super tasty. The half portion of this entree would have been sufficient for me to order on its own. The Beni also had a perfect egg, yummy pork belly and asparagus, but the herbed biscuit was the star here. Reminded me of a savory shortcake,

Mom opted for the Madras mimosa with mango, strawberry, while I had the Rose Lemon. Both were perfectly blended and delicious.

Prep and Pastry has something for everyone, There are a handful of veggie forward items and even a lunch menu. I am looking forward to returning the next time I am in town.

4380,3888,1,4,2,0,1,"When I heard that Prep & Pastry had cronuts (or, as they call them, dossants) I had to go check it out when I was in town visiting family. I met one of my oldest and dearest friends at Prep and Pastry for brunch on a Sunday. There was a wait to be seated, however it was only about half the time that we were originally told which was nice. 

I started out with some tea, which I was pleased to see there were numerous options to choose from.... I was struggling to make a decision so I ended up letting our server select an herbal white tea for me, and really enjoyed what he brought me. 

Since my main goal in dining at Prep & Pastry was trying some of the baked goods, I made sure to pick a couple of those out first... I had the Samoan dossant, which reminds me of my favorite girl scout cookies. (I also took a peach mango glazed dossant home for my momma). The dossant was deliciously decadent, exactly what I was hoping for and more. It was so good, I had to get a second one to go. 

Since I started out with sweets, I decided to go a little lighter and healthier for my actual meal so I ordered the housemade granola served with fresh fruit and vanilla yogurt. What a steal at just $5! The granola had dried berries as well as fresh raspberries mixed into it, and it was topped with apple and strawberry.

My dining partner had the duck confit which she said was delicious, especially the goat cheese mousse. Service was a little on the slow side, but never to the point where it was an issue...

My sister-in-law is pregnant and ordered over-medium eggs with her breakfast. When they arrived, they were very clearly cooked over-easy and extremely runny. Being pregnant, she has to avoid raw egg and needs to have eggs prepared safely, so she wasn't able to eat these. As most people do, she felt extremely bad asking our waiter to prepare her another batch and was really kind about it (not a Karen I swear). The waiter was visibly annoyed. When he returned, the eggs were yet again over-easy and barely cooked. Nothing had changed. When he asked if these were okay, she hesitated but ultimately said no and they took them back again. When they returned, both yolks had been broken and the eggs were 100% cooked through. I feel like this was some passive aggressive punch to say ""hey, are they cooked enough now?"". Not only was this rude, but my sister-in-law still never got the eggs she ordered. At this point, it wasn't worth saying anything (because they clearly weren't going to make them correctly) so my brother ate them and we left. Like I said, I'm so incredibly disappointed because I really loved this restaurant. I have been here countless times with friends and family. Now, I have a sour taste about them. How do you work as a chef and not know how to prepare an over-medium egg? Also, how come you can't be nice to someone when they ask for a change in their food? It's embarrassing enough to ask but even worse when your waiter makes you feel bad about it.

4400,3902,1,5,13,4,13,"Oh Prep & Pastry,  you've been open less than a week and Tucson clearly has a crush on you. I had to see what all the fuss was about... I went for breakfast this Saturday morning with my husband and baby, we were promptly seated although the place was bustling and mulled over the gourmet breakfast options. My husband went for the Biscuits & Gravy made with duck confit and I opted for the AM Rellano. Both were more gourmet versions of the homestyle dishes and seasoned impeccably. 

Before leaving we also had to try the pastry part of Prep & Pastry. So I ordered the blueberry & earl grey tea scone. I was skeptical about tea IN my scone rather than with it but it blew my mind. All the warm mixture of flavors just like sipping tea with a scone was there. I can't believe I haven't had something like this before,  so familiar but so innovative! The tea makes the blueberries pop. Let's just say the scone didn't make it home,  or even out of the restaurant.

4408,3908,1,5,1,0,3,"P&P has such a popular reputation that I was hesitant to review it until I had been here several times- Is it really that great or do I just think it is because that's what everyone says? But after my most recent visit, a conclusion had to be made.

I've never had a bad meal, or even a mediocre meal here, despite the fact that I've been here when it's really busy & with BIG groups. Big groups, small groups, alone even, and the overall experience is consistently, overwhelmingly lovely. Of course the wait is pretty much always long, but I can't hold that against a place when it's just an adverse side-affect of popularity. 

With such an extensive, regularly changing menu, I would expect to have experienced a few more misses. But everything I've ever ordered has been a hit. I really admire the creativity behind every dish and love to go back again and again to try the seasonal items. And I feel like I say this a lot, only because it really matters to me, but the service is always personable and they don't forget little requests like that extra cup of ice or second coffee refill, even when it's packed. 

On this particular visit today, my table ordered the Nutella French Toast, the sweet breakfast bowl, the Brussel Sprout toast, & the veggie eggs Benedict. We shared everything, of course. The Nutella French toast was the perfect ratio of brioche to whip cream to Nutella and honestly didn't need syrup. The sweet bowl was addictive and complex. My favorite part was the caramelized bananas and peanut butter with the crunch of the granola; which all made me forget that I don't love yogurt. The veggie eggs Benedict had a crunchy-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside Bread base (no sogginess!) with extremely flavorful carrots and some kind of (?) delicious sauce. The potatoes on the side are the best kind of breakfast potatoes- crackling but soft, not too greasy, with plenty of flavorful herbs.

However, the star for me was the brussel sprout toast, which was inexplicably crispy and nutty and tangy and sweet all at once. I think there was a honey drizzle which complemented the definition-of-an-over-easy egg and slightly charred Brussels in an unexpectedly delightful way. 

So yeah, that meal did it for me. I finally had to tell you all, it really is that great.",2/12/2018 19:16

One time the smoked salmon was way too salty and the very nice and accommodating  manager gave me a free meal to go, explaining that he was still training new staff.  My boyfriend loves their French toast and I've tried the s'mores one, which he LOVED, but I thought it was way too sweet. However, the Cure is one of the best things I've ever had, sophisticated and not too sweet! However, they do need to serve many their items with more sauce....we are always left asking for extra and it's always delicious. Sadly their duck gravy and biscuits sounds amazing and was recommended to me as a specialty, but was a big disappointment ... i'm not sure if in trying to make it more healthy they may have skimped on the gravy, but this is silly with a dish like this, and consequently the dish was extremely dry....also the flavor is actually lacking in the gravy, which seems unlikely with the addition of duck! In general, the service is fantastic, knowledgeable and attentive. The atmosphere is creative and beautiful in both locations! I really like the fact that they have coffee available while you wait at the Campbell location (always a wait so prepare!).

4477,3967,1,2,2,0,1,"When you look at the menu, it's not unexpected to encounter an anticipatory longing for a unique and delightful culinary experience. It was this anticipation that had been fueling my desire to experience all that Prep & Pastry had to offer. I mean really; how does Biscuits and Duck Fat Gravy not elicit an invitation to excite the senses? 

Sadly, these senses were far from excited. When the entree was served it looked beautiful. Three in house prepared biscuits lovingly enveloped in the aforementioned gravy with pillow like pouched eggs atop all the joy I had been looking forward to. On presentation I was a bit concerned as no steam was visible from my plate. And then, the sadness began. My first bite was frigid. Not lukewarm; cold.

Perhaps this was a new interpretation of the meal? I asked the server; is this dish meant to be served cold? Needless to say his expression was a clear; no. My dish was quickly removed and shortly thereafter a fresh exchange was provided.

Now, one would think after the first time; a correction would be appreciated. Not so much. This time we graduated from a cold entree into a lukewarm entree. 

Unfortunately, these are the high points of my experience. However, I am undaunted. I will try this establishment once more. Where else can one find such tantalizing amuses like ""Duck Fat Gravy""! 

To the owner; PLEASE here my plea. If the dish is meant to be served HOT; advise the serving staff to refuse a plate if on receipt it is not steaming. Your restaurant has such amazing allure; it just fell short on execution.",15/11/2015 1:01

Ordered the Pork Belly Beni and Breakfast Poutine which we already know from other reviews and table-stalking they're going to be amazing.  

This is the place Tucson has been missing!   So excited to have this beautiful place to enjoy Sunday brunch.",23/3/2014 18:03
4519,3999,1,5,2,1,1,"Tucson brunchin' at it's finest! Delicious delicious food, consistently amazing service, bigger space at the new location, but VERY loud inside.

I like how spacious their new location is (still on Campbell), my only issue is that the acoustics inside are TERRIBLE. It is so hard to hear the people you're sitting next to. I would suggest sitting outside if you can stand the wait or the heat in the summer time.

Now the food... my goodness, the food is ALWAYS delectable.
1) ""Steak"" and Eggs Croissant - One of our new favorites. The tender and juicy meat sandwiched between the flakiest butteriest croissant, is pure perfection. Need I say more?
2) Chicken and Toast - I love a good chicken and waffles remake. The chicken itself was cooked so well and their french toast is melt in your mouth and filled with flavor. The perfect sweet savory combo!
3) Any of their baked goods - Their baked goods are made in house and you can tell how fresh they are. The selection changes, so always peruse their pastry case and pick at least one out to try!",21/11/2019 22:05

I got the sweet potato hash with over easy eggs and though it was really good. It was filling enough that I didn't feel cheated on the expensive dish, but not too filling that I felt like I couldn't move! 
There seems to always be a wait here no matter what time or day, which is good for their business but kinda annoying for patrons. They should expand their seating if they are getting this much business!

4523,4001,1,5,2,0,1,Visited this place all the way from San Diego and I will say that they easily have top 3 best breakfast potatoes that I've ever ate. I mean them bad boys were nice and crispy on the outside and perfect in the inside. That in itself blew me away. Now let me get to the steak and egg sandwich which was on a nicely buttered slightly toasted I think sour dough bread. The steak was tender and the sauce or cheese I think on there was delicious. My fiancï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½e ordered the Beni which was really good too. The biscuit that they used was thick yet moist and didn't get soggy which I was surprised that it stayed so perfect. Additionally the customer service was outstanding and there wasn't a long wait to be seated. Heads up though because you do pay for your food before being seated so research a little bit for what you want to eat. I'd try this place again and I highly suggest that anyone local or just visiting give this place a go too. This was definitely one of the better meals I've en,6/9/2020 21:33

4531,4008,1,4,1,0,1,"I went here for my birthday in November and again last week with my sister. The first time I was here, I could not stop raving about it; my husband thinks it's just ok and couldn't understand why I liked it so much here. The second time I came, I came to understand his view. It was just OK. Both my sister and I are foodies (she's a yelp elite because she bothers to write reviews, and I don't). We shared the green chili french toast, monte cristo, and an omlette. It was all lack luster. I mean, it all tasted good, just not GREAT like the my first experience.

Most notable was the monte cristo; it was a little disappointing because there wasn't much meat in it, and what little there was, it was unevenly distributed. The sandwich was cut in half and she got about 90% of the meat in her half, and I got mostly bread and some cheese. When I let management know this, they immediately apologized and took it off the bill. I'm going to let it slide as maybe their off day, because I really liked the initiative they took with the customer service, and because my first trip left such a great impression on me. 

In talking to the manager, he seemed genuine in his concern for my disappointment in my visit, and he expressed how this is not common and not up to standards for their restaurant. What a great manager with strong people skills. I believe him. I'll come back with more people so we can all talk about and compare our next experience.",8/4/2018 4:31

The decor is bright and beautiful, very modern with all their staff wearing uniforms. I had the chefs special which was a churro French toast with chocolate glaze and strawberries on the side. It was heavenly. We also got a donut that was stuffed to-go. All of their food is fresh and fluffy, just perfectly curated.

The only thing that fell short was their coffee, it tasted watered down and was just flat out bad. But their food and efficient service made up for that.

Our server was friendly and checked on us multiple times. She was always refilling our waters and somewhat present, without hovering. It was also Saturday brunch so she was SO busy! Hats off to management for efficiently staffing the restaurant!

one of our wonderful elites (amanda d.) put together a UYE (unofficial yelp event) last saturday. she worked with the owners to set up a good time and location on the patio to accomodate about 25 of us. 

billy took care of us and he is always such a pleasure to see!! he took such great care of us the entire time we were there.

we got to try cronuts (or, doughssants, whatever you prefer to call them) which are a cross between a doughnut and croissant. one of them tasted like a churro and it was amazing! they even had the frosting on one of them dyed a yelpy red, just in our honor!! the other sweet treat we got to try was their chocolate chip french toast. it was all very good.

i am not so much a breakfast person so i opted for their grilled cheese and tomato soup. the bread is rubbed in parmesean and the inside is filled with several delicious different cheeses. i opted for no tomoato in mine. i shared a bit with a couple others at my table and we all agreed that it was very tasty!!

everything looked amazing on everyone's plates and i have to saw we all had a wonderful time. i will definitely be back, and highly recommend this place to everyone to go and try.

I understand they're usually pretty busy, but two staffs were doing nothing but just looked at us without saying hi for 5min when there were 3 or 4 tables available. 

It was very warm inside. Tried to ask my waitress if the AC was working and she said yes but it wasn't working at top capacity? Why not? It was 12:30 and almost the hottest time of the day. It was working but not cooling it didn't make sense. The family sitting next to us complained of the same thing. Also another waiter asked us what source we'd like, we said ketchup he said no problem but he just completely forgot it.

Plenty of syrup and hot sauce helped but I wouldn't get this overpriced fish again. The group raved about the steak and egg sandwich so I'd try that next time.

If you're in the mood for one of their deserts make sure to get them when you first show up because they go quick and they sell out.

4570,4034,1,5,0,0,0,"I'm a professional photographer and blogger from Phoenix.  I'm also a food guy.  I don't often write about food, unless it really matters, when I find something really cool, worth sharing.  I blog; this is my VERY first review on Yelp.   My work has taken me everywhere; my love of food has lead me to all the best eateries in all the places I've been.  This establishment was recommended to me by another ""foodie,"" a local friend, who understood the kinda place I would really enjoy.

This restaurant, Prep and Pastry, is an EXPERIENCE  in the best ways.  It's the place I will be telling my chef friends is a ""MUST EAT"" in Tucson.  It's not lavish or posh, but the ambience is perfect.  The design and layout is modern, but homey and familiar.  It's clean, with a great soundtrack, very pleasant and very approachable.  It's most definitely ""today"" and also ""tomorrow.""  It's everything right about creating a dining experience.  

Let's get to the most important aspects of the dining matter...service and food.  Great food overshadows bad service, but the service in this place is impeccable.  We were not the only diners at the Thursday brunch, but we were treated like we were; glancing around, so was everyone else.  They pay very special attention to prompt service, more importantly knowledgeable and accommodating service.  I'm not difficult.  I like good things.  I like staff that knows what they're serving, and I like staff that enjoys doing what they're doing.  The service here is a very good thing.  The food...oh, the food...I'm still thinking about it.

The food here is everything I want from food.  It is INCREDIBLY thoughtful; it is absolutely beautiful, which can often be found in any high end eatery, but the FLAVORS here matched the beauty of the plate.  I LOVE where these young entrepreneurs are going with food culture.  It's the future of food.  I HIGHLY recommend The Cubano; it's a sandwich I'm very familiar with, having eaten them in every Cuban joint I could find in this country, and in Havana.  Locally sourced ham, with hand pulled duck confit, in house pickles, stone ground mustard, absolutely flawless bread, pressed and cooked to an absolutely decadent and balanced perfection.  I will say without a doubt, it's the best Cubano I've ever eaten.  I'm also Jewish, so I'm a deli fanatic, and some of my feelings are more nostalgic than objective.  In saying that, knowing my favorite sandwiches around this country; it's also the best sandwich I've ever eaten.  Ever.  

My partner, who is in the business herself, had the salmon.  Salmon on a sweet corn puree with pesto and roasted tomatoes.  I have to tell you...it was one of the prettiest plates I've seen.  I've eaten at Moto, when you could eat the menu, when Chef Cantu was still with us. I've seen pretty.  I've seen pretty without substance, like eating a menu.  This is NOT that.  Every bite belongs together; every element stands on its own, but is best experienced as a whole.  It all fits.  That's what I want from food.  Locally sourced, or made in house like Prep and Pastry does, nothing OBSCENELY over the top, but ALL of the very best ingredients married into ultra modern comfort food, basically.  It's not pretentious, which is what I'm ultimately getting at.  It's approachable AND perfect.  You won't feel disappointed in any way; it's owned and run by folks who LOVE food.  The entire staff loves food like us ""foodies"" love food.  They love dining like we love dining.

Prices?  To me, the least important thing about experiencing unforgettable food.  You will NOT find better food at this price point.  Ever.  Not anywhere in America.  When is the last time you had pulled duck on a sandwich for  $11, let alone one with ANY in house ingredient or local, socially conscious ingredient?    You never have.  Ever.  I haven't, and I've eaten everywhere.   Again, this is the brilliance of these young restauranteurs.  The arrangement of their business model is exquisite, designed for them to have fun and be creative, and also deliver the very best product, that's not gonna hurt your pocketbook in any way; it won't shorten your vacation.  You will NEVER eat better this inexpensively.  We took our first bites and sat back in our seats, in food bliss, that high you get when everything great about food comes together seamlessly.  

You can really gauge the passion of a restaurant by the effort they put into their sides, normally afterthoughts, just quick money.  The sides are as well thought and masterfully prepared as everything else on the menu. I live about 100 miles from this restaurant.  I will be making the trip to eat here again, PURELY to eat here again, for the service, the food, and to support a business and the people behind it that I hope stay around for a long, long time.  

Thank you, Kevin and staff at Prep and Pastry.  I rarely write about food.  Thank you for the inspiration.

I've had their Pork Belly Sandwich, Chef's Omelette, Cronut pastries are out of this world and the best in town, made by Pastry Chefs.

I'm picky so I discarded the asparagus paired with the beni (though I trust they are amazing as well) so minus that, the entire order tasted wonderful. The goat milk hollandaise and the cheddar herb biscuits are wonderful. My only other (picky) critique is the grizzle on the pork but ofcourse this is practically unavoidable when preparing this dish. The poached egg was very soft and seemed to melt in your mouth, though my favorite ofcourse is the yellow goodness that comes pouring out of each egg. The side for this meal were home potatoes I believe and they were phenomenal. I (I'm gonna say again, PICKY) have probably found one other restaurant that has really good potatoes, so this place is definitely added to that list! I can't go into much detail on the poutine bowl as I only had one bite, but it included the fry, greenery, and meat ofcourse with the sauce and it was AMAZING!!! I've found so many poutines to be overly salty (coming from a salt lover) but this dish just tastes so good, balanced really what you would imagine if poutine had a gourmet recreation (which I deem this is!) And to top it off, we were lucky enough to bring home a chai tea dossant (I can't betray my cro-nut ways) and it was again... inCREDIBLE! There were so many defined flaky yet dense layers topped with a chai tea glaze and a cinnamon sugar dipped bottom- utter bliss. Overall I highly recommend this location and these items specifically.

4587,4046,1,5,0,0,0,"What a great place for a casual breakfast with a small party!

The atmosphere reminds me of a breakfast shop in San Diego, with blue chalkboard walls, exposed wood ceilings, and a very open feel.

They offer a considerable number of adult breakfast drinks, homemade and frankly amazing pastries, and a great selection of classic breakfast dishes with a culinary twist. My personal favorite is the friend chicken and french toast--it has a hint of rosemary, and comes with a delicious blueberry compote. 

They have delicious coffee from local roaster Exo.

My personal favorite dosant (donut/croissant) is the maple bacon, but I have to admit I haven't had one I don't like. 

Make sure to get here early or be ready for a wait. I like coming on the weekdays when they open--the crowd is small and there's no wait! Also, I would limit my party to 4 to sit comfortably and be able to hear everyone. They have one nice long table that seats six, but you'll need to be there early for that one.

4610,4066,1,3,5,0,0,"We've been to Prep & Pastry twice now. Our first visit a couple of weeks ago yielded what I would call a mediocre experience, but one with potential. We gave it a second shot this morning which yielded similar results. Not to be a smart-ass, but everything honestly could use a little more prep and attention to detail. Read on.

The Pros: 
PASTRY and COCKTAILS - between two visits now we have had great experiences with both the pastry selections and the brunch cocktails we've ordered. On our first visit we had a chocolate croissant with an amaretto drizzle and it was amazing. The amaretto drizzle was brilliant. Whoever is in the back slinging pastries is on their game. The maple-bacon doughssant (doughnut made with croissant pastry dough) was a perfect balance of savory and sweet flavors on a fluffy and flaky pastry delivery vehicle. This morning we had an Earl Grey and Blueberry scone, and it is the best scone I think I have ever had in a restaurant. Again, the pastry chef is cranking these babies out proper. Perfectly light and moist with an Earl Grey sugary drizzle. Delicious! Lots of folks coming up to the bar just to order pastries to-go as well. We've tried several different cocktails now and all have been tasty. On our first visit we tried the watermelon mimosa and the red sangria. Both we expertly mixed by our bartender/server, Vinh. The watermelon mimosa was a refreshing surprise. I'm definitely taking this inspiration for my own cocktails at home this summer. This morning we both had a bloody Mary and it was great, not too boozy, but still had a little bite. I like the spicy bloody mix and the bacon/olive garnish was a nice touch.

SERVICE - If you sit at the bar and Vinh is working, you're gonna get great, attentive service. We had a really nice conversation with him on our first visit and he was genuinely interested in how our meal and experience at the restaurant were. Dear owners, he's a great asset. To be honest, I don't know who served us at the bar this morning because he didn't really introduce himself and engage us like Vinh did. However, the service was decent and he still made a good bloody Mary. We really enjoy sitting at the bar.

ATMOSPHERE - This restaurant is a total package when it comes to concept. The font and typeface on the menus and wall decor exactly reflect the type of place and food ideology that I think the owners must be shooting for. The music that plays is usually just the right volume. A lot of places these days confuse their dining room for a nightclub and have music blaring which totally kills conversation. If I have to raise my voice or repeat myself a lot with dining companions odds are that we will not be coming back. However, Prep & Pastry gets this part perfectly right. Noise is what I would call a conversational average. The general decor and the staff all seem to be pretty laid back and evokes a little of a Pacific Northwest-y kind of vibe. I dig it.

The Cons:
FOOD: We've only tried breakfast dishes so far on both trips. All of them have suffered from the same general issue:attention to detail.
We had the Corned Beef hash and the Duck Confit hash. My idea of corned beef is a tender succulent bit of meat when it is done properly. The two (generous) slices that I got were both chewy/tough enough that I had to ask for a steak knife to cut them. That really shouldn't be the case. The gnocchi that came with the dish were ok, but not quite crispy enough. They had fried them, but apparently not hot in a hot enough pan/oil, because they were a bit soggy. The flavor was good, but the texture could've been a little more done. If you're frying something, get it done. The winner of the entire dish were the brussel sprouts. I asked for them to be a little extra done, which they said they could do. The flavor was great. They laid the whole dish down over some kind of carrot puree, which was tasty, but it was cold. The duck confit hash was very little actual duck, maybe 2oz. at most. Biggest offender? The potatoes were all under-cooked by about 2 minutes or so I'd say. That's a rookie kitchen mistake.
This morning we split the breakfast poutine. The chunks of pork belly were tasty, but a little over-cooked. The gravy was seasoned slightly and the dish was drowning in it. The dish needed a little more of a pronounced salt note. The fries were cooked decently, but swimming in a bowl filled with gravy turned them in a soggy mass. The cheese was plentiful, but was just one gigantic congealed mass covering the dish and not really curds as they should have been.

The second time I visited the restaurant I came in on a busy Friday afternoon with a coworker of mine. There was only one outdoor table available, which the hostess took us to. Upon getting to the table we realized it was being swarmed by flies, and decided we would just wait for another table (note: we were not in the least bit upset, as this is a common occurrence with outdoor seating everywhere). 

We were immediately given a space at the bar and a complimentary donut, upon which time an employee rushed up to us to apologize about the fly situation, and let us know the restaurant was working on getting it fixed. We assured him we didn't mind, but he clearly felt very badly about it, and went on to offer us beverages on the house. On top of that, every employee we talked to after that also offered extremely genuine apologies, and upon getting our check we realized they had also given us an almost 50% discount.

4712,4147,1,3,5,2,1,"Just because you're different doesn't make you ""better."" I had a Monte Cristo with a side of bacon and the fiance had a Simple Breakfast with a side of sausage (their pork sausage as they explain).  So I suppose I'll break this down as I normally do:

The Good:  The skillet potatoes served with the meal were good.  Although dicing potatoes, frying them up and sprinkling salt on them is nothing special or amazing.  But they did manage to not burn them or anything.  The drink menu is a brunch alcoholics delight, plenty of mimosas and other alcoholic based drinks to make your morning that much more bearable (and likely geared to make you forget you're paying way too much for that huge slice of bread).  The compote with the breakfasts for toast and the Monte Cristo was actually very good (and the highlight of the breakfast for me).  

The Meh:  I don't really have anything for this.  My fiance said the ""eggs were eggs.""  So I guess they can make an egg.

The Bad:  Expensive.  $9 for the Simple Breakfast after adding a side of sausage was excessive.  The breakfast sausage, they tried to be different, but if my fiance had expected her breakfast sausage to taste like a hamburger....   $9 for a Monte Cristo that can't even meet the basic requirements of a Monte Cristo?  Let's dwell on this for a moment.  

So, most definitions of a Monte Cristo indicate it's supposed to be a ham (or turkey) sandwich, with cheese, french toast style bread, and dipped in scrambled egg.  What I received was 2 slices of bread each about 1 inch (yes, if not 1 very nearly an inch thick) with a slice or 2 of ham in between and some cheese.  The bread was put on a grill on top and bottom to brown it (and maybe melt the cheese inside), but nowhere was there a hint of egg.  So while the bread was not dry, it was not moist either (as that seems to have been cooked out of it.  So when trying to spare enough of the compote they serve for the whole sandwich in the tiny little metal container they give you, you end up needing to wash down bites of the sandwich with water because the copious amounts of bread soak up any moisture in your mouth and lodge the bite in your throat.  I asked for another little metal cup of compote and they brought it out.  That made the rest of the sandwich easier to eat, but I still required frequent sips of water to replenish lost moisture soaked up be the massive amounts of bread that made up this $9 ""sandwich.""  The cheese was good when I could occasionally taste it in the gobs and gobs of bread that were smothering the scarce amounts of other ingredients.  

The bacon.  Let's talk about the bacon.  They explained to me the awesomeness of their bacon even when I was already ordering it (I didn't need convincing, although after I received it and ate it, I can see why they need to convince people).  Coffee / coffee ground / green tea cured and soaked whatever bacon sounds ""interesting"" when they describe it.  The bacon arrives, and it's 2 strips.  2 strips of bacon for $3.  One might think this gold-plated bacon should taste amazing.  Upon tasting, this special treatment doesn't make it taste anything but funky.  It's got a weird taste and tastes very salty on top of that.  Give me some applewood or honey cured or any standard packaged bacon that runs at $3/lb. any day compared to this.  Even if this was awesome, $3 for 2 slices of bacon is robbery.  

It is time to leave.  They seem to be targeting a somewhat upscale but artsy look.  Upon visiting the restroom prior to leaving I'm kind of hoping they do something interesting there.  I walk in and feel like I'm visiting the restroom at the local gas station chain that pays their employees well and keeps their bathroom nice.  Right down to the industrial-style pink soap they offered.  For $3 for 2 slices of bacon I'd like to believe the establishment could've gone one step above industrial pink slime for their soap choice.  

Let's not forget to mention that there are apparently enough Tusconians convinced this is a wondrous breakfast experience to the point that the wait was about 30 minutes right before noon.  I waited a way long time to pay way too much for a lot of meh.  This is one of the first times I've been seriously disappointed with a high Yelp rating.  I have to believe it's the entire half of the brunch menu dedicated to getting sloshed that's helping their ratings, because it really isn't the food.  The only reason this gets 3 stars instead of 2 is that they didn't mess up the potatoes and my fiance enjoyed her mimosa and the staff was generally good.",12/11/2014 6:41

It's hard to believe that something so simple could be as amazing as it actually was. I've been craving it ever since. The girlfriend had the beni and loved it as well, although I can't really comment on it because I'm not a huge fan of asparagus or the bread that they use for it.
A lot of the sub-5-star reviews for this place seem to be related to people feeling insecure about fitting in or whatever- this place can't magically give you better existential feelings of confidence and security, but if you're looking for an amazing, original brunch, you have to try it.",13/9/2015 0:43

Ordered The Beni*. It's a pork belly Benedict with poached eggs and hollandaise on cheddar biscuits. It's served with their potatoes which are deep fried and smashed. So tasty. The food was promised in 15-20 min. I also ordered a coffee. When I arrived, the lot was full. I parked illegally and ran in. They guided me to the bar where I paid for and received my order. 
The bar tender asked if I wanted my coffee hot or iced. I asked for his recommendation and received an ice coffee. It was good! Silverware was in the bag with a napkin. And the hollandaise was on the side! Very nicely packed. Thank you. 
As I left, I saw some pastries in the case. I was surprised there were so few? Maybe they were selling out. I only wished I saw them at the bar or was asked if I wanted to add to my order.

The greens inside were not as prevalent as the first two times, and to make matters worse, they forgot the egg inside....., wow!!...., talk about going down fast, hyper speed....

I started with the Thai Fighter breakfast cocktail and then had remorse when I saw the 'build your own mimosa' set up. But ultimately I was happy with my choice. For breakfast it was another hard decision - do I go sweet or savory? Plant based or full on fat? I honed on on the Sweet Potato Hash which came with an over-easy egg and a delicious house-made goat cheese mouse. As soon as I got my plate, out came someone else's brioche doughnut with lemon glaze on top. Again I envied the person who went with the sweet dish compared to my favorite Ash.

I have to say, that while I enjoyed my breakfast...eggs cooked the way I wanted them, bacon was good, whole wheat toast was cut from a loaf and not out of a plastic bag.  Potatoes for everyone else were great, smashed fried potatoes with great seasonings.  I'm just one of those people who does not like potato skins, unless they are crispy.  My sister was not impressed with the french toast, but our friend enjoyed the pancakes.

This place is way to noisy.  For that reason alone I would not recommend it.  Maybe I'm getting old, but I would like to be able to hear the people I'm  at the same table.  Bummer.

When we arrived there were quite a few people hanging about the front of the building waiting for a table. We checked in with the hostess and were pleasantly surprised to find a water/coffee station (which we enjoyed during our wait). After about 15 minutes, we were seated.

The menu was simple yet appealing. Upon much deliberation, I decided on the duck confit. Oh my sweet baby Jesus was it delicious! My husband had the monte christo and my daughter ordered pancakes. Everyone was very satisfied with their meals!

This was hands-down my favorite place to eat on the entire trip. I showed up soon after they opened on a Monday morning, and was seated right away at one of the tables in the windows - meaning I had a nice view both inside and outside. I found the decor to be sophisticated and comforting, like the menu. Being close to the UA campus means the clientele is mostly on the young side, as are the servers. I felt right at home in this environment and appreciated my waiter's knowledge of the menu along with his recommendations.

I ended up ordering the A.M. Relleno, the center of which is a large poblano pepper expertly roasted and garnished with eggs, pico de gallo, queso fresco and tortilla strips, all covered in a delicious mole sauce made with seeds. The flavors complemented each other amazingly. This dish is an outstanding take on the Sonoran cuisine for which the area is renowned. I added a couple of freshly baked pastries from the large selection on display in the window to the bakery side of the restaurant. The Monkey Bread had an incredible raspberry cream, finger-licking good. The other was a buttery Danish with which I wiped my plate clean. For drink I had a black tea so good that I reused the same bag three times. All the ingredients are fresh and locally sourced, making them a pleasure to experience.

Service was friendly and not intrusive. I wish I had two stomachs to try some of the other things Prep & Pastry is reputed for, like the scones and any of the dishes with duck fat in them. I guess that's why another visit is in order next time I visit Tucson. What a fantastic find - highly recommended!",29/12/2015 22:09

4803,4223,1,4,2,1,1,"Usually I give myself a couple of visits before making a judgment, but since I was only in town to visit a friend, this one visit will have to do. 

My outgoing flight was at 10:15am, so we showed up suuuuper early at 7:30am (my usual brunch time is... like... noon or later LOL) and were seated in no time. Apparently if you come later in the day (aka my idea of when brunch is), there can be a good one hour wait. The decor was absolutely charming and pretty hipster. I totally joked to my friend that I have gotten her to take me out to like, the MOST Bay Area/hipster restaurants that you could possibly find in Tucson. 

I got coffee (I mean, 7:30am!!!!) which was great, but the star drink of the show are, very clearly, the mimosas. I ordered both the Prickly Pear and the Prep Royale- preferred the Prickly Pear but both were great!

For my main, I got the Cast Iron Duck Confit, while my friend chose the Sweet Potato Hash. Although I LOVED the ooziness of my eggs, there were a few issues there- I mean, while I thought it was a good-sized portion, it was presented in a bigger dish, which gives you the immediate visual impression that they didn't give you enough. Second, the dish was unevenly salted- but easily overcome by combining with the eggs. 

Another star: the ""dossant"". We got the raspberry/pistachio/matcha dossant, and I can tell you that I would've never expected to see matcha here, but I was so, so, so happy to. Fantastic layers, and the combination was perfect, with the burst of fresh raspberry juiciness, nutty pistachio and an authentic matcha taste. Seriously fantastic and one of my favorite things during my trip. 

Service was super nice although a bit slow- I did remember looking at the clock and being nervous that it was maybe 8/8:10am and we still had not received our food. Our server was friendly and even offered to get me coffee in a to-go cup (too bad the airport won't let me take it through security). 

Overall, I give this a 4, even though the main dish had a few issues. If I'm ever in this area again, I would definitely come here again.",24/4/2017 0:56

Some other girl brough our food and our waiter min were to be found. We started to eat. My fiends French toast looked super yummy. But wen she started to eat was dry dry and didn't have any flavor it was just like eating a pice of bread. So she didn't even eat but 1 bite. My Croissant was burn  talking g about the hole part BLACK burn so I took it apart and just ate the insides. The potatoes that come with it has rosemary and some other seasoning. I didn't like them. So we were there for 30 min and finally our server came and ask if we needed the check becouse we pushed our plates to the side. I looked at my friend and we answer Yes please.

I would probably even say quaint, if it was not bursting at the seams with people. We were waiting for a table for about 45 minutes because of the number.

Inside the tables were close together and with the number of people, it was actually difficult to really even take in the rustic decor or the homey feel you would have had without so many people.

Our waitress was nice and filled the drink orders quickly. Two of us got mimosas: the Prickly Pear and the Fuzzy Navel. The were nice, light and refreshing. Maybe not the best mimosas I have ever had but definitely above average for me. The food took a bit longer to get ... probably over 40 minutes. It seemed long for breakfast but maybe it was what we ordered and that they were busy. My sister and I split The Beni (overall, actually pretty good and I have no real complaints) and the Cast Iron Duck Confit (duck was great, the potatoes though were not very flavorful though).

It is a little expensive for breakfast, but I cannot say that I was surprised. Overall, it is a nice place to get brunch, if you are in no rush to go somewhere.",19/4/2017 1:26

I chose a skillet that contained potatoes, duck, and eggs, and cherries. There were other lovely details in there as well but I admit I just inhaled this dish and practically licked the skillet. There were about 2 smears of shallot left when I got through scraping out the pan. You might think that fruit does not belong in a dish like that, but it did. The duck was delicious, moist and flavorful. They managed, somehow, to keep the potatoes crispy even though they were topped with a number of things that should have made them soggy. Eggs, needless to say, are perfectly cooked. The whole thing was topped with a scoop of goat cheese mousse. It tasted good but I didn't feel that it necessarily complemented the rest of the dish, plus I found it a little hard to cut at with my fork in order to get balanced bites of the dish.

We have always gotten there around 7/7:30 on the weekends so there has been no wait, which is great! Sign up on their website and get some coupons emailed to you occasionally!

Food:
Seasonal quiche: this might be the best thing I have ever had anywhere. We came back a 2nd time to have it but it's not on the menu anymore. Hoping I'll see it back as the ""seasons"" change. 

Biscuits & Gravy + Eggs + Fried Chicken: SO DELICIOUS. The gravy is flavorful without being overly salty. The scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked and the fried chicken added a nice crunch. 

Chicken & Toast: Ordered this for the fried chicken and that did not disappoint. The french toast was not great but I think my childhood memories of french toast are of a delectable breakfast that does not actually exist.

I ordered the Beni, which has pork belly, asparagus, poached eggs, goat cheese and hollandaise on an herbed cheddar biscuit. The biscuit was delicious! I liked how they packaged the food; the poached eggs were soft-boiled,  and then peeled. I have never seen that presentation and liked how I could get the runny yolk out when I wanted it, rather than have it already served cold and congealing on the food. The potatoes on all the orders were crispy and delicious!

4832,4246,1,5,1,1,1,"""Brunch without booze is just a sad, late breakfast"". What a great motto for this place - and for someone visiting from a state where alcohol is so withheld. Prep and Pastry has been on my list of places in Tucson to try, for a while now. P&P was my first food visit on this summer Tucson trip, and will be a constant stop in the future. 

When ""Prickly Pear"" is mentioned anywhere, I need to get it - especially in Arizona. Thus, the Prickly Pear mimosa became a necessity. I'm use to $4 mimosas in Salt Lake, so $7 I thought was a bit pricey... however, it turned out to be one of the best mimosas I've had... ever.  The mimosas are made with champagne and tea - Maya's. The top was accented with a lime segment, and it was excellent. My mom went with ""The Cure"" mimosa - lemon and blueberry, and it was just as enjoyable, with a twist of a lemon peel and two blueberries to form a smiley face on top.

With my need for prickly pear, I completely looked over the rest of the cocktail menu until after I had ordered. my next visit will require a Thai Fighter cocktail - another unique mix of flavors that have everything I need in this life. 

I've seen tons of pictures of P&P's unique dossants [or cronuts as the rest of the world calls them ;)] so this visit became a time in which I was to indulge in a donut (something I tend to not need in my life). Their pastry cabinet is a tease - you see it immediately on your left when you walk in, so I peeked, I pondered, I watched from a far, and decided that my dining companions and I were going to try the Strawberry-Basil Mascarpone Dossant. 

I loved it because the dossant was not extremely sweet. The top was adorned with half cut strawberries, and the overall creation was fluffy - the way a crossant should be. I ended up eating the majority of it, and was 100% fine to do so.  I suggest anyone stopping in to experiment with one of their extremely fun pastries! Indulge, man. 

Now to the main course! I got the Morning Prep omelette: a delicious vegetarian concoction of spinach, goat cheese and delicious tomatoes. This also came with a side of Prep's amazing potatoes. I think food portions are wonderful here: they are not excessively large per some breakfast spots, and I still left...absolutely stuffed.

We sat on the patio, and were given the brunch menus to order off of. The first thing I noticed on the menu was the Breakfast Putine, since it was in bold lettering, smack dab in the middle of the page. I wanted to order the grilled cheese with tomato bisque, but they didn't have gluten free bread. So I decided to stick with my first choice of the Breakfast Putine. It took a good amount of time for our food to come out, and this was understandable since it was a busy Sunday morning. Finally, I was served my dish, which consisted of pork belly, duck fat gravy, house made fries, cheese curds, and two over easy fries. This was yummy and super filling.

The monte cristo was a tasty mix of sweet and savory, although I didn't notice any pineapple jalapeno flavor from the mascarpone. The duck confit could have been super, until I was left with mostly Prep's potatoes and spinach. The duck was pretty dry but it paired really well with the cherry goat cheese mousse.

This place was recommended to me when I was planning my first return visit to Tucson since moving away in 2004.  I was there with hubby and daughter in Oct 2014.  Thanks to the advice of Yelp reviews, we decided to come on the Monday we were in town rather than the weekend (arriving around 9:30am) and so did not have a wait at all.

I started off right with the advice on the menu (""brunch without booze is just a sad, late breakfast"" um, genius!) and ordered a cosmo-inspired mimosa.  Let me just say that I thought I had died and gone to heaven-- better than any mimosa OR cosmo I have had... the raspberry was SO raspberry tasting.  It apparently also had a little thyme in it, which is my favorite herb.  Since I was the only lush at the table, I didn't order it but I noticed they had a really cool concept which would be perfect for a boozy girls brunch: a mimosa build-your-own, which was a bottle of bubbly and a choice of any 3 juices.  Genius!  Hubs enjoyed his coffee too, which he said was an above average cup of joe.

I think I've waxed poetic about the drinks enough, moving onto the food.  Hubby got the Beni (pork belly, asparagus, soft poached eggs, herbed cheese hollandaise) and I ordered the Berry Compote French Toast (brioche bread, maple syrup, vanilla poached berries and stuffed with berry compote).  Halfway through our plates, we switched.  They were both incredible, and hubby had his paradise moment with his first bite of the Beni.  I was sweating for a minute there that he wasn't going to hand it over at the halfway point.  For the little one, who wasn't finding what she was looking for on the menu or in the pastry case/shelf, the restaurant went off-menu to give her a side of toast and Nutella, which was much appreciated by us!  They only charged us for a side toast ($1.50), which was kind.

We sat outside in an idyllic courtyard area and a fountain that allowed our antsy kid to play around a little and keep entertained by throwing pennies into the water.

This is the kind of place that if you don't go while in Tucson, you've really missed out!",17/1/2015 21:46
4857,4268,1,5,0,0,0,"Great food, decent service and a fun atmosphere.  Well worth a visit when in town and would be a ""go to"" place for me if I lived in the Old Pueblo full time.  I really liked their selection of both breakfast and lunch items.  The pulled pork Benedict was fantastic and the potatoes are legit - crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  

My wife had the spicy egg dish in a skillet that was very good (I had a bite) and the mimosa was a good value too.  Lots of seating options both inside and out and with the open sliding doors they have, you can enjoy the fresh air and still be seated comfortably inside.

This place definitely lives up to the amount of glowing Yelp reviews! We ordered an omelette and their classic french toast ""to share"" and they brought out our orders exactly divided up so we each had a mini-omelette and 2 of the 4 slices of french toast which was so nice of them. They have a chicken and waffle or poutine breakfast special on their weekend menu too!
The service is great even with how busy they are and they're always coming around with more coffee, even offering us another cup to go!  My only complaint is that they don't have any espresso drinks on their menu! We were way too full to try their pastries but they look amazing and I definitely want to next time we're in the area!",20/1/2020 23:19
4865,618,1,4,1,1,1,"My first visit here was the worst, but then I decided to come a second time because some people from work and I were throwing a goodbye breakfast for a coworker and she really likes it here. I think I might have ordered a bad plate last time but I got totally different items. 

I got Jamie's michelada... DANG that blew me away from how good that was! Totally wasn't expecting that. It's basically a beer version of a bloody mary and usually when I ask for micheladas at places that aren't known for micheladas (besides mexican/latin restaurants) they don't turn out so good. OH!! they even put TAJIN on the rim! Which to me is the cherry on top to any michelada or bloody mary. So breakfast already started out with a nice bang with that drink.

For food I ordered 3 things. The french toast, a side of potatoes, and Turkey Sausage. All were SO good! The french toast was thick, full, and sweet, the potatoes were cooked to a golden crisp, and the turkey sausage was absolutely savory.

The people around me got different foods. This other coworker usually loves it there and she did not like her plate at all. Others seemed to enjoy their foods. They supposedly changed the way they serve their potatoes (which was a disappointment to others, but i thought they were yummy!) But I was surprised by my awesome breakfast meal compared to my first bad experience. 

From what I hear from friends and see from experience, Prep & Pastry is a hit or miss. You don't always get something good, but when you do... it's delicious!",3/6/2016 11:14
4866,2025,1,4,3,0,0,"I've only been here once and my dish was not edible.  It was corned-beef hash and the corned beef was all gristle.  Also, it wasn't a hash, but what I was told was ""our version"" of a hash, which in fact was a deconstructed hash, which in fact makes it the opposite of a hash.  The replacement was a duck hash.  The duck was hard to find but the scalloped potatoes were not.  I took them home but they were al dente so I didn't eat them.  Undercooked potatoes, ugh.  Neither dish was a hash. 
The problem is is that hash is not a food in itself, it's a process or mode.  I can do different versions of eggs: scrambled, over easy...but doing a different version of hash can't mean not-hashing it, which is dicing, primarily, then optimally having it get crusty in a cast iron skillet.  Restaurants need to be careful of ""versions"" of things.  Bodega had their version of a caipirinha and by doing so, made it not a caipirinha.  They used acai berry instead of lime, which is saying that the only thing that makes a caipirinha a caipirinha is that it's Brazilian, so we're going to add a different Brazilian fruit.  Nao, nao nao, as they say in Bra-s-i-l.  My caution is when putting one's signature on a dish, do not forget its essence.  One can argue:  But basically, my version of a car is a bicycle; see what I mean?  Maybe to someone who wishes to save the planet from noxious fumes, it is his/her version of a car.  But to me, a version of a car still needs to be some type of car.  
I loved the professional staff, the courteousness of then finding me a dish I would enjoy, the atmosphere, and the goal of making me, the customer, happy; they succeeded on all accounts.  In fact I might even go as far to say that the only way for me to truly test my unconditional love for a place is to find out how much they strive to ameliorate in states of dissatisfaction.  Perhaps not the best way to test bonds in an amorous relationship, but I'll give it a go with casual dining.
So I'll be back.  Because they won me with their charm and service, and I think other dishes deserve my attention.  With their attentive service and eagerness to please, they are destined for success.",20/6/2014 19:37

Would be nice if they offered a premium alternative to that mediocre wine.  Service was good.  Food and service warranted 4 ratings.  The lower rating was because of the hundreds of flies that chased us from the patio.  I complained to the server and the a manager and both blamed the heavy monsoon.  But we have eaten at other patios with some flies and bugs, but not the density of flies at this place.  The patio floor did not look like it had been washed recently and the table top was sticky.

This place attracts an amazing variety of customers: Hippies, sorority girls, grandmas and grandpas, and the best of all... lumbersexuals (those suave young men with 1930s coiffed hair, well-oiled beards, flannel shirts, skinny jeans, and leather brown boots).  I guess I can sum it up to just : ""brilliant people-watching breakfast place."" 

The breakfast cocktails are just out of my mind. When you order any cocktail breakfast drink-- you are basically doing this:  ""just get highly buzzed on an empty stomach, then you'll become sober by eating a huge breakfast meal."" LOVE IT!

Back in the day, this was the only breakfast place that my husband and I would eat at, but now because of all the new places opening up, we have not been here for a while, but trust me, every time we talk about breakfast, this place is top on our list. 

We have dined in the patio and inside on weekdays and weekends and have always been pleased with the service and the food quality. My go to was always the smore's french toast. It not as moist as I would want it to be, but still tastes delicious with the marshmallow cream and the chocolate syrup with graham crackers. The portions are huge and the dishes can easily be split between two people. 

I have also tried other things from here such as the matcha chia pudding, unique concept and tastes great with a hint of healthy. The chickpea scramble is my new favorite, it's vegetarian option with a great twist on serving eggs with chickpea base, instead of potatoes to keep it healthy.

I placed an order for Easter Sunday food late the week before.  Green chile quiche, fresh cinnamon rolls, potatoes, and bacon plus a mimosa kit.  The mimosas were great - a decent bottle of Proseco and a fresh rosemary honey syrup that added great flavor and a beautiful lilac color. 

Sunday morning pick up was easy - the staff was hustling and helpful. They were wearing gloves and masks, and everyone waiting for food was in good spirits and observing appropriate distancing.  

The food was packed in high quality togo containers and reheated easily as directed when I got home.  Everything was delicious!

Classic French toast 4/5: Fluffy and not overly sweet. Our only critique was that it didn't include enough berries for the amount of toast.

The food here is amazing. Every single dish I've had here has been delicious; I have never been disappointed. My favorite ""healthier"" dish of theirs is sadly no longer on the menu (Return of the Mac), but I am a big fan of their omelettes. My husband frequently gets Chef Kayla's call, which is her rotating special French toast, with a side of fried chicken and it is fantastic. This combo was suggested by one of their super friendly servers and we are forever grateful to her for it.

The drinks - best brunch drinks, best bloody Mary around. The bloody Mary is like a meal in and of itself and comes with a shot of coffee stout and a full skewer of charcuterie on top. They have an assortment of mimosas to choose from, my favorite being the Madras (mango, pear, and orange). Coffee is perfect.

The service - always fast and friendly. A few years ago at their old location there had been a long wait for the food we ordered (although we didn't even notice ourselves, being occupied with our drinks) and the restaurant voluntarily comped our drinks. That is amazing service.

The side of potatoes that is my customary breakfast side, was also very tasty, just got a little too much rosemary at the end so it carried more of a tree taste than potato.
My husband got the Savory Breakfast Bowl which he advises to definitely combine all the ingredients together for a much better taste. The tomatoes weren't very good but once removed, everything else worked well together.

The restaurant apparently doesn't accept reservations so my friend tried calling in to see if she could have her name put on the waiting list. That phone conversation was a disaster because whoever picked up the phone couldn't hear anything that she had to say and kept answering something different from whatever she was asking. That didn't work out.

Fortunately when we arrived at the restaurant, a couple of other people in our party had put their name on the waiting list. We probably waited around 45 minutes before we actually got seated.
Pro tip: if you want to get seated earlier, then ask for the first free open table. If you're wanting to sit on the inside only, and not on the patio; you're probably going to be waiting a bit longer because that's what happened to us.

Anyway, the service was pretty average. It started out good where our waiter was attentive and able to answer all questions that we had. But throughout our dining experience, he was pretty hard to find. Trying to order a drink proven to be a challenge.

Foods were delicious and the portions were about right - enough to get you full, but not too much. The people in our party were raving about their drinks (I didn't drink) so they had to be good.

Prep & Pastry opens at 8 AM. We got there just before 9, and it was already buzzing. The inside is small, but we didn't feel cramped sitting at our table for two. The interior is sweet, with blue chalk board walls, vaulted open beam ceilings, and a French farmhouse feel. There was large, chunky wooden breakfast bar area off to one side, and they had some gorgeous breakfast pastries showcased next to it. 

The menu is not overly extensive, but their offerings are varied and include unique interpretations of some common brunch type fare. My husband and I both wanted the corned beef hash, but he won it on a coin toss; second runner up, upon recommendation by our server, was the duck confit hash. Both were delicious. The corned beef was tender, perfectly seasoned, and trimmed of all fat. The brussel sprouts were lightly blanched, and the perfect accompaniment to the roasted baby potatoes. The duck confit was moist and flavorful, and paired nicely with cherries and spinach (a combination I would never have thought of) and came with roasted baby potatoes as well. Both were topped with a perfectly poached over easy egg. In fact, ""perfect"" most accurately describes our entire meal.  We ate every last morsel - there wasn't a speck left on either of our plates. The coffee was some of the best I've ever had, and the servers made sure our cups were always full. 

The service was fantastic. You might expect there to be a certain amount of chaos, given this place only opened a few days ago, but our server was smooth and efficient. He was also friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and food preparation, and looked startlingly like a Calvin Klein model. We noticed that a couple of families had come with small children, and it was nice to see that the restaurant made accommodations for families. 

Right now, Prep & Pastry is only open for breakfast and lunch, but I would love for them to expand into the dinner and dessert arena. It's the perfect backdrop for a romantic date. 

A bit off subject - but I was so excited to see The Grey House located right next door! I see myself making frequent visits to Prep & Pastry in the future.",20/1/2014 21:53

We both had plans of ordering something else, then ended up with churro French toast because that was the chefs choice. It was good with nice plating, (syrup, chocolate and star berries), but the only thing that made it ""churro"" was a slight sprinkling of cinnamon sugar. It was really just the same as other French toast, but still tasty. I wish I had stuck to what I was going order originally.

When I walked in it was super busy with people waiting everywhere for a table. I walked up and was greeted as if I was the only person standing there. How long of a wait for one, please? Five minutes was the reply. Let me clean the space at the bar. So I waited while she cleaned and then I sat down. I was greeted by the bartenders. I asked about the Bloody Mary and was told spicy. Ok. Looked at drink menu (after scanning QR code) which I loved. I ordered ""up till the sunrise"" and scanned the food menu. The menu, let me say this, is not huge (which is awesome) but know you're going to want to try everything.   More convo with the bartender about what I was going to eat. He told me their fried potatoes were to die for. He would be so very very right. So I ordered the Prep omelette. It came with those most amazing potatoes. The kind that somehow manage to melt in your mouth. Not fried too hard. Crispy in the outside. Tender and soft on the inside. OMG. Get them. My omelette was also very very delicious.  It had a slightly salted avocado on top. The goat cheese spinach inside was to die for. I also ordered an English muffin. It was served w strawberry jam that was delicious. The English muffin not so much but when I shared the feedback it was removed from my bill. It just wasn't good. I'll leave it there. My cocktail. Was like a dish of food on ice. In a good way. It was beautiful first of all. Then with each sip I took it was layers and layers of flavors. Not complicated. Not sweet. But a true cocktail made with fresh ingredients and simple syrup in house. So good I ordered a second one. 
Everyone was so nice. From the moment I walked in until the moment I walked out. The servers wear blue and white tops with jeans. It is a casual joint for sure but service was awesoMe. Food was fantastic. Cocktails were fantastic.  I had an fantastic experience. Highly highly recommend. And when I was leaving, I was given a blueberry scone for the road. While it was baked a little too hard for my preference it had a most fantastic flavor. I ate as much as I could before grabbing my flight back home. Vacation is over.

Good luck on parking. It's a decent lot but this place gets pretty jammin. Their pastries are as aesthetically pleasing as the restaurant itself. It's a pretty place to have brunch. The drinks are fun & stay consistent with presentation & alcohol content. I'd recommend coming during the weekday if you can because the weekends are way too busy. Have a super chill friend - or your self, go put your name on the list cuz it'll be a wait. Their old location further North on Grant was smaller so I'm grateful they went bigger in order to accommodate their local fans.

All I can really add is, that if you do plan on coming here on a weekend, make sure to get here as early as possible, because the line will quickly get out of hand if you get here even around 10AM.",14/7/2017 21:00

This restaurant is extremely busy for brunch.  Went at 11 am on a Thursday and waited around 30 min before being seated.  When we were seated the menus had a bunch of water still on them.   Additionally, the tables are all located extremely close together making the dining experience quite noisy and I found myself straining to hear what my friend was saying.  

On a more positive note, the staff was extremely nice and efficient.  

The food was delicious and beautifully present BUT the sweet potato was quite undercooked and  noticeably VERY crunchy.  Staff was busy and didn't want to be That customer.  However the favor of the food was spot on and had so many flavor combinations to enjoy.  Really enjoyed the goat cheese paired with the over easy eggs.

We had a good run, and you've shown me some great times despite the lines, but I've fallen out of love with you and deeply in love with someone new. Someone that goes even further to prove that it's worth going OUT to eat breakfast and brunch when most spots don't do it much better than an average home-cooked meal. Someone who loads me up with brut, rose, and pastries before closing since they'd have to be thrown out otherwise. Someone who knows how to perfectly crisp up potatoes to get that delicate crispy exterior loaded with flavor, yet the velvety soft comforting interior. Someone who treats me right and really gets me. 

Okay the weird romantic metaphor is going too far and getting creepy at this point, but it still stands, PREP & PASTRY BABY! O la la! This is the best brunch spot I've ever been to, though it's always hard to decide on what to eat...

White wine sangria, perfectly crisped potatoes, homemade jams, impossibly FLUFFY fresh sourdough...my word. The only thing I didn't vibe with was the sweet bacon, but you could tell this was some fancy top-tier bacon. 

Listen, I'm a huge brunch person but it's hard to justify unless that brunch place really sets itself apart from what you can make at home easily or the thousands of other places making mediocre stuff you could find anywhere. Prep & Pastry does that with outstandingly human service. I went here multiple times and felt cared for by different staff who genuinely wanted me to have a great time and made sure I did even though they were busy.

We came back to check on the order after 10 mins and were told again it would be ""another few minutes""  several times. After waiting for almost an hour after the time they told us it would be ready, the host informed us they ""forgot to put in our order""  and it would be 30 more minutes. He then offered my girlfriend cookie for the wait, no apology, no ownership of the mistake. Wow. Ive worked in the service industry for a lot of years, it's a terrible look to offer customers a cookie to wait for 1.5 hours total for their food it's almost insulting. We left.

What I can say, collecting some of the feedback that I overheard during our group lunch experience, is that the raves are well earned. We found the duck confit skillet is delicious, the burger and grilled cheese/tomato soup entrees are not only tasty but generous for the money, and one person said that this was the best omelette she'd ever had. 

Perhaps unique to our experience, a gentleman held the door and chatted with us for a few minutes as we prepared to leave. He asked where we were staying, and made a glowing recommendation for other restaurants in that area. It turns out that we were talking with the owner of Prep and Pastry. I thought that was really classy of him to pass some love to other businesses.",12/10/2018 14:03
5040,4405,1,3,3,0,1,"I have been here around 3-4X and I think it's just ok.

The place is cute and charming and they have yummy brunch drinks. I like how you can get an assortment of juices and a bottle of bubbly so you can have a ""make your own mimosa"" bar right at your table. These aspects make it a really nice place to have brunch with your girlfriends.

However, I am not a fan of the food. I think all the food is just meh. The duck confit hash and the steak and egg sandwiches are just ok. Also, I really dislike the chile relleno here. It makes me wonder if the person who came up with this dish has ever had a chile relleno. It  tastes so bland when the description on the menu makes the dish look super appealing. On the other hand, the pastries are pretty yummy.

My overall opinion of this place is this: I won't oppose coming here if someone invites me, but I wouldn't come here on my own.",9/3/2016 1:49
5041,826,1,5,5,1,3,"Awww Prep & Pastry gives my lazy weekend routine a reason to get out of bed earlier. It is so cute and so delicious. It would be the kind of place you would expect to find in a hip area of a big city. Small in stature, but HUGE in flavor. The inside is cozy and small but still manages to feel airy and open enough. 

The food is innovative but doesn't stray into ostentatious. I had a very hard time deciding, everything sounded so good. You could tell each dish was thoughtfully put together. In the end, we ordered an amazing breakfast of French toast and A.M. Relleno. The berry compote on the french toast was delicious with a sweet creamy texture. However, I love that it wasn't over-the-top sweet (that fine line that keeps it from verging into ""I should have just eaten desert for breakfast"" sentiment territory). 

We also ordered the A.M. Relleno which was brilliant. It was a poblano  pepper stuffed with scrabbled eggs and queso fresco and covered with spicy mole sauce and a corn salsa and then garnished with something along the lines of tortilla strips. It had spicy, creamy, crunchy, egginess - my idea of an awesome breakfast. We finished with coffee and a lemon thyme scone.

They serve breakfast//brunch//lunch (with three variations of their menu) Came here for a late breakfast and had the sweet potato hash and an iced tea. Sweet potatoes were nice and crispy, well-seasoned and combined with corn, leeks and spinach & topped with 2 perfectly cooked eggs.

Dad had the meatloaf sandwich. Great char on the outside of the meatloaf, nice rustic bread, fresh greens. Only had a bite so can't say too much more on that one but it was delicious. 

Service was great, attentive without being overbearing. Server brought more ice when she refilled our iced tea (HUGE points in my book for that one - it's Tucson for peets sake, ice melts?!) Anyways, thank you for that. It really is the small details that do it for me.

Ambience // decor was very cool without being pretentious & neither super funky nor Foothills ritzy, a welcome change from all the typical  Tucson spots, made me feel like I was back in the Bay Area for a moment.

I'm met a colleague here for lunch. Arriving slightly early I found the service was uber attentive. I felt almost like a celebrity walking in. When I arrived, the hostess seemed genuinely happy for me to be there. It wasn't that awful pink, sugarcoated type of welcome that feels somehow sour. I might have guessed that she was the actual owner of this establishment. Same with the server. Very complementary and very helpful. 

I ordered the tri-tip sliders. This is a sizable order for lunch. I wasn't able to finish the meal, but I enjoyed it well. 

The sliders are served in the form of a glorious cheesy biscuit. The biscuit has a wonderful herb flavor. Reminded me of chives and cheddar with a hint of saltiness.

The sliders were served with a sampling of potatoes which had a nice flavor of onion and red bell peppers. Nice accompaniment to the sliders.

I will have to give this place another go. I was happy to see that you can order breakfast items up until 3 p.m. Also, they serve mimosas and they have duck confit.

Great location for a business meeting and, I'm sure, a lovely place for a romantic date.",9/7/2014 2:21
5091,4439,1,5,1,0,1,Delicious pastries and brunch! I had the lamb with a fried egg and potatoes- the meat was so easy to pull apart and seasoned to perfection. I tasted a small piece of the grilled cheese and that was delicious as well! The churro donuts could have used a dipping sauce like chocolate because they were a bit dry.

Don't stall, order the hash, because it's worth it. I would say skip the lemon French toast because I didn't find anything about it too amazing, but to definitely order a cocktail! I had a michelada and it had muddled cucumber which was extra refreshing.

5100,4437,1,5,1,1,1,"So ecstatic that my friend just introduced me to Prep & Pastry. We went this morning for an early morning breakfast, and I could not be happier with my experience. This place is definitely a place I'll be visiting again! 

To begin, the restaurant is very cute with some rustic feels. The hostess looked really happy to see us and had us seated. Almost instantly, a young man brought us water and told us that  our server would be with us in a moment. Our server was Ryan, and within five minutes he came and let us know what the daily specials were. He took our drink orders and told us he would be right back to get our breakfast choices. I ordered a cranberry tea which was delicious and for $2 I ended up getting 3 steeps from the same tea (yay!). My friend got the citrus tea and she loved hers as well. 

I ended up ordering the chef's choice pancakes. The chef makes new things each day (different pancake of the day, french toast of the day, etc.). The pancakes this morning were walnut and chocolate chip. I ended up getting three huge pancakes for $7, and they come with syrup (which was good, but I'm not a huge syrup fan) and creamy whip. I actually ended up taking half of my breakfast with me. I was not expecting such a huge helping, but was glad to have it. The pancakes were delicious!

My friend ordered the basic breakfast, which comes with toast, eggs, and potatoes (hash). She's a vegetarian, and Ryan made sure to let her know that there was no meat in any of these products and no contamination. BUT! They do have several vegetarian friendly options if you or your friends are veggie lovers. Next time, I might actually try ""The Mac is Back,"" which has vegetarian sausage. 

The service here is just as wonderful as the food. All of the servers seem to work in unison, and we saw several different servers refilling people's water, coffee, etc., when they were running low even if it wasn't their table. When Ryan brought us our checks, we had just finished putting our cards in, and a different server asked us if he could run them from us. Several different people asked us if we were enjoying our meal as we ate. Basically--they have great attention to detail. At one point, my friend asked for some honey for her tea, and they provided it. She also ordered a scone to go, and they brought her a HUGE scone in a box. 

I ended up paying $9.73 (before tip) for 3 pancakes, 3 cups of hot tea, and a glass of water (I had about 2 glasses). I'm definitely coming back here! I can't wait to try the lunch options. But the breakfast is great. There were several things on the menu I'd go back to try out!",16/11/2015 21:29
5107,418,1,3,2,1,0,"Ok, so this might get me ostracized in Tucson since people rave about this place, but I have to say that our experience here was just so-so.  We had to wait 20 minutes for a table and another 20 minutes for our food, even though we had decided what we wanted before we sat down. The decor is too monochromatic for a good game of eye spy. The food was fine but not worth the price- almost 30 bucks before tip for breakfast for two when one of us is only 10.  The food was pretty though.",4/9/2017 18:34

I told the waiter I was celebrating my birthday and I received a Cronut!  It was all that I'd hoped for, all 5 years of waiting to visit (I used to work whenever my pals would go).  The food was great!  I chose the salmon benedict and since I was having a difficult time choosing between the sweet potato hash and the bennie, the waiter offered to switch out the regular potatoes for the hash!  Problem solved!  And boy, I am glad I did because the hash was to die for!!!! I will absolutely be enjoying it again!  It had leeks, onions and soft not mushy, magnificent sweet potatoes.  The coffee wasn't too strong and definitely not 2nd crack, as I wouldn't expect. The price was right.  The only thing I didn't care for was the bread the salmon bennie comes on.  It was the texture of a bagel and I had a hard time cutting through my benedict without tearing it apart.  Other than that, I was a happy camper!!!",25/10/2016 1:00

5118,4459,1,3,0,0,0,"We've been here 3x since it's opened. The first time we went it was packed and we waited a while to get seated, but the food was definitely worth it. The second time we came it took FOREVER for my husband's food to come and the service was unbelievably slow. They were nice and gave my husband a pastry to snack on while he waited for his meal but we didn't come back until today. We came in around 10:45 and were told a 10 min wait. We actually got seated before that which was great. Our waiter came and brought us waters and then left before taking drink orders. That's when the visit went downhill. We're hanging out waiting for our waiter to come back and take our drink order and he never comes back. He takes the orders of two other tables that sat down after us and ignores us completely. There were several other servers as well that kept going to all of the tables but ours. It was bizarre. We were just about to get up to leave when my husband caught the eye of the hostess. She asked if everything was okay and my husband told her that we had been sitting there for 10 mins without anyone taking our drink order. She was super sweet and told us she would be our server and took our order and brought out our drinks right away. She continued to check on us and make sure we were all good, but the original server continued to act like we weren't there. It was really uncomfortable because he continued to service the other tables and help with the other servers but never once checked in on us. Our food came out about 15 mins after we ordered and was mostly good. I got the Monte Cristo sandwich with home style potatoes and scrambled eggs. The potatoes were incredible! The sandwich just reminded me of a grilled ham and cheese on fancy bread. Usually monte cristo's come with a sauce for dipping but this one had it on it but it didn't really taste like it. My husband got the fried chicken and French toast and he loved the chicken but said the French toast was pretty blah. It didn't really taste like French toast to us, it was pretty bland. When we were done eating we ended up having to get the hostess again for our check. She was nice enough to give us a 10% comp for waiting. So to recap, the food is decent but the service is weird. The hostess is really great though and seemed to be doing everyone's job. Give that woman a raise!",4/10/2021 21:29

We started off with dessert - 2 pastries. One strawberry scone - huge and perfect with their local bottomless roast coffee. One vanilla bean and fig dossant. My first ever donut-croissant...not sure why it took me this long to try one! Amazing!!

And for brunch I ordered the braised pork belly sandwich.  Meat lovers will fall in love with this! All that fatty goodness and over easy egg yolk gushing all over your fingers from taking one bite...worth it! Maybe better eaten with a fork. And you get a side of some spuds.

The strawberry shortcake French toast was quite delicious as well! If it were me, that would be a shared dessert for at least 3 people after an entree.

And finally, the steak and eggs sandwich didn't make it into a to-go box. That got devoured quick!

The prickly pear mimosas are strong and delicious. I was feeling myself after just one. But that may be because I'm a light weight.

I got the quiche for food. This was the most decadent thing ever. The quiche is cooked perfectly and the crust is so flakey and awesome. Don't get this if you're trying to be healthy FYI this dish is meant to be comfort food-y. Unfortunately I found a hair in it towards the end of my meal (sad face).

I ordered a doissant to go (spelling?) but ended up eating it there because it looked scrumptious. It tasted good, but I wasn't blown away. I think it was the flavor I got, chocolate and almond? I'd recommend another flavor.

Breakfast sandwich...the homemade english muffin is heavy, especially when melded to two different cheeses, while a really nice sweet and smoky bacon provides a punch of flavor and the fried egg provides both bulk and drippy yolk for the muffin to soak up.

The restaurant's ""new"" location looks out on bleak and frenetic Campbell Avenue. 
The restaurant's service did not disappoint. The drinks were creative and outstanding.  The servers were friendly and accommodating and, as I always am able to test, quick to offer something else if your meal is not what you'd expected.
This is a highly perplexing establishment that offers stellar service and dishonest food. What you think you're getting you don't get; and if you do, not much of it. This is signature P&P and the reason I never go back. Hash is ""our version"" of hash, seasonal vegetables is fries, and a meat sandwich is 3 ounces meat in 16 ounces of bread. This restaurant is a used car salesman in a designer suit. 
My meal dissatisfaction garnered a salad since no one could find any ""rotating"" seasonal vegetables that were prominently promised on the menu, and my meal was generously comp'ed because I wasn't quite satisfied with the same old plan of getting something else when what I wanted was about 15 minutes ago on the menu -- you can't replace timing. 
Next time I return it will be to cash out the gift certificates, or at least spend it on the cocktails, which hopefully don't have seasonally rotating (aka missing) ingredients. My dining partner said this place has gone down in quality.  I retorted, Nope, it's exactly the same.",21/2/2020 16:55

The mimosas were wonderful. My daughter who goes to U of A has been there multiple times and loves the food despite having to wait an average of an hour or two each time.

After 30 mins we received a text that our table was ready. When we approached the hostess we were told we were next to be seated. 3 more parties were sat before us. When we asked how much longer because we felt in the way inside the hostess looked annoyed, said we were up next, walked alway, and proceeded to sit another party larger than mine.

I did have good intentions about coming in here earlier than 2 p.m, and participating in the UYE... but unfortunately I was too tired to get up around 9 a.m to attend. Anywhoo.. I started off with an ice coffee that really kickstarted my Saturday morning.. erm afternoon.. I asked if they had an espresso machine so I could have a latte or something, but they said that all they had was plain old coffee, which was fine with me. I then ordered the french toast w/ berry compote and that was pretty delicious. It came w/ a side of syrup, but I didn't even put it on my toast because frankly that would have been a little too sweet for my taste. I give the french toast 4 stars.. simply because it was a little ""soggy"" even in the corners where sometimes if I am really lucky I get it served to me crispy.. the way I like it! 
My friends got an order of the pork belly beni as well as the duck confit.. I was pretty much salivating when the duck confit came out because not only did it look good.. but it smelled amazing. Portion size was also perfect.. so that will be the thing I get next time I come in. Now.. the pork belly beni was not so perfect.. the portion size was small, friends complained the pork belly was too rubbery.. and overall for $9.00 it simply didn't steal the show... All in all it was a successful brunch out... and although the service was really spotty.. (we had around 3 different people servicing us that day, and we needed to flag someone down for the check) I will definitely be returning.. the shabby chic farm decor and the food is too inviting for me to past up!

5234,235,1,3,5,0,1,"So I'm writing this accepting that many people I know probably disagree. However, my central thesis is that I totally get what they are trying to do with the Tucson take on the post-gentrified urban overpriced brunch spot but remain largely unimpressed when it comes to taste and substance. I will also add I've been here several times hoping for the food to be as good as it looks like it should be. 

If you come here, be prepared to wait in a long line varying from 20 minutes to two hours. Yes, it gets that long on a Sunday early afternoon. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as there are plenty of places worth waiting for. 

I also find it a bit overpriced based on what you are getting. The menu items are all well conceived, artfully described, and intriguing. But not one time have I left this place feeling like it was worth the time, money, or effort, and I've ordered several different menu items. The bottom line on food is the however well designed and concocted the ideas are, it always tastes no better than what I could prep (pun intended) for myself at home. If you are fine paying $12-20 per person for something that you can make at home then good on you; if not, consider Bobo's or Cup Cafe which deliver a far superior gastronomic experience. 

The reason I am giving this 3/5 is purely because of the aesthetic and experience it offers, and each time it reminds me of the similarly presented but superiorly tasting brunch spots I've enjoyed in other havens around the country. I also love that they serve exo coffee that you can sip while you wait, and their cocktail menu (which begins to make up for what this place's food lacks in taste).",14/5/2017 18:59

The complimentary coffee while you wait is a nice touch. Cute spot for a date- girls love brunch. 

I had The Toast which was the ""special"" but it wasn't anything near special. I guess it wasn't bad, but I don't recommend cold toast smothered with ricotta for $10. 
My sister had the simple breakfast- bacon was outstanding, and the toast and scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly. She also recommends the Tropical Sunshine tea which you get to press yourself.

Dad had the Eggs Beni. For Eggs Benedict the eggs should be poached, but one had brown edges, which means it was fried.. Or it was poached and that's a whole other problem itself. I don't have a degree from the Culinary Institute of America, but I did pass 10th grade chemistry- and I know a poached egg shouldn't be brown. 
But all of this would've been ok if it was HOT. We don't mind plates being brought out early, but then the expectation should be that it's hot. Had the plate been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 min waiting for the Duck Confit to be ready?? ""They wont know""

5310,3763,1,4,12,4,8,"I visited Prep & Pastry for the first time this year, and I've been about one or three times, give or take. I have to say, I was never really interested whenever I looked at this place because the food was not intriguing to look at. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a go. I can't say I was pleasantly surprised but I also can't say I was disappointed. Some items were a hit, somewhat, and some items were a miss, somewhat. From memory, I had: biscuits & gravy, the dip, classic (french toast but pancake), a dole doughsant, and the brunch punch cocktail.

Getting into it-

Interior/Exterior: The inside is so cutely decorated! Getting to the location is a bit rough and the parking kind of sucks but you win some you lose some. 4/5

Ambiance: It is always busy here! I am not complaining, despite the fact it's always buzzing with people, it never takes too long to be seated. 5/5

Food: Given the price of these items, I would expect a liiiittle more seasoning. I found some of the food a bit bland, don't get me wrong, still palatable but for $14 I would've expected some more of a kick out of the dip. I ordered the classic french toast at one point but they were out and so they offered me a pancake instead. My fault, I'm not really keen on pancakes but they were alright, nonetheless. I didn't finish them though. Their pastries are amazing, no complaints! The alcohol will kick you while you're down, which I appreciate. I've personally had better biscuits and gravy and probably would not order again. 3.5/5

Price: A bit overpriced, in my opinion. Maybe it's to add to the vibe but you can easily rack up a bill here for a handful of dishes and a coffee. 3/5

Customer Service: All the waiters, hosts, etc are so nice! 5/5

Overall: A decent place to visit with just about anyone, but nothing particularly groundbreaking. 4/5

This cute establishment is still one of my favorites in Tucson, and during my last P&P visit in May, I was very happy to see they had some plant-based options - I hadn't seen these on my previous stops in. The chickpea scramble is amazing, and will leave you completely satisfied.  It has a little bit of everything I want in it: plant-based ""egg"" scramble - chickpea, avocado, veggies, jalapeno-tomato jam, and most importantly: potatoes!! YES.

Being a Utah girl, finding alcohol served at whatever you time you want it, is an absolute treat. So of course mimosas are in my breakfast schedule while in town. On suggestion from the server, I got the Rose Lemon mimosa - and it was amazing. Per usual. Their mimosas are really hard to beat. Whatever you do. Get a mimosa. Someone in my party tends to always get the house bloody mary, which comes garnished up, but also with a beer back. This place is so damn cute.

If you eat pastries, you need to get at least 2 when you stop in. They are gorgeous, and were excellent (at least when I had them two+ years ago when I ate dairy product). Patiently awaiting a vegan pastry...

My husband asked the server for her recommendation since it was our first time dining amd she recommended the poblano Benedict and it was spot on! Our 9 year old snagged so many bites from his Benedict dish, he recommended she also order it next time   we ended brunch with a chocolate chip cookie and an olive oil pound cake with fresh berries and cream! We would order any of these dishes again, but will likely try a few new options during our next visit as many items on the menu looked delicious! The facilities were clean, everyone had on masks, and they had ample room outside for us to wait in comfort until our table was ready! Great place for brunch!!",29/3/2021 0:22

5384,4644,1,5,0,0,0,"We're currently on a roadtrip and decide upon consulting Yelp as we typically do to try Prep & Pastry for bruch this morning. 

From the moment we walk through the doors, we know the experience would be memorable. The friendly hostess jots down our name and informs us of a 10-15 min. wait. Not a problem. It gives us time to peruse the vast menu and peak into the pastry case so we could narrow down our choices to three selections. Yes. Three. We couldn't resist. Of the three, we only remember that we had ordered cherry pie, which turns out to be our favorite because of its fresh, flakey-moist crust (Is that even possible?) and what seems to be homemade filling with just enough sweetness that the tart still comes through in subtle notes. 

The other two delectable choices are a blueberry something and ...?? cinnamon-y, cream cheesey donutty something. Both are tasty but probably best enjoyed by those with an insatiable sweet tooth. We still share half of each, but if we can only choose one: P&P's Cherry pie it is.

Now, on to the main course. (Dessert almost always comes first in this family.) While I order the ""Cast Iron Duck Confit"", hubs eyes the ""Harissa Shakshuka""--and both of us achieve brunch nirvana instantaneously upon first bite. The braised duck's tender morsals make my tastebuds dance, and with that cherry goat cheese mousse topping the goodies that comprise the dish, all melt in my mouth with flavorful bursts. Of course, eggs over easy make the dish a perfectly special morning meal. Hubs reports the pork in his dish (the other choice is turkey) delicious and the roasted red pepper sauce a nice accompaniment atop the marinated olives and sunny side up eggs resting upon crisp-edged, soft sourdough bread slices.

I've bookmarked this spot for future stops in Tucson (scheduled for August 2021 when we attempt Route 66 from California to Chicago); there's simply much more on the menu that we must try.",17/3/2021 5:36

My takeaway from all of my Prep experiences is that if you want to come for a leisurely, relaxed breakfast, get there before 8:30. I feel that after that it gets too busy to allow the servers their usually pleasant interaction with the guests.

There was another server who kept coming to check on us (no clue why, our server was doing a great job) and kept commenting on how wonderful our food choices are. It was a bit weird and annoying. 

The food itself was okay. We ordered the pineapple waffles and pork sandwich and split both dishes two ways. The waffles were good, but other than a dehydrated piece of pineapple that topped the dish, there was no other pineapple. Strange! The pork sandwich was not so great. It had good flavor, but the meat tasted very dry. The fries that come with the sandwich were very tasty!!

We went on Sunday morning at about 11 AM.  The place was packed with some folks waiting outside to be seated.  Put our name on the list and waited for 20 minutes as the hostess had said.  Water was provided outside while you wait.  You can sit outside or inside when dining.  Luckily we chose outside because the din inside when crowded is disconcerting when you want to relax and catch up with your pal without background jabbering. Outside was perfect.  They have three menus to choose from. Breakfast menu Monday to Friday 7-11 Lunch menu Monday to Friday 11-3 and Brunch Sat. and Sun. 8 - 4.  We were there on Sunday and they don't have the same choices as the weekday menu.  They only make pancakes during the week.  No problem for me.  They have some lovely choices. My friend had a salad with spinach and fresh strawberries, bacon,  and a very tasty dressing.  I chose the omelet which had tomatoes, cheese, olives and a side dish of small crispy potatoes.  It's a really unique place as per the name Prep and Pastry,  they also have many scones and pastries to offer.  Especially the Cronut.I believe they are famous for that one.   I will be back to try some other of their wonderful delicacies. The restaurant seems like the personification of success. Rightly so.

Bacon+Maple.. that is some good stuff.... Sweet+Savory but not as sweet as the cinnamon sugar... I wish there was more than 6 pieces of bacon on my dosant, but thats just cause I am a fata***....

Holy moly I am unsure which one I favored more because they were both delicious.

We were seated within 2 minutes after arriving, and it worked out perfectly. After that, we had almost non-existent service. I had to refill my coffee myself from the front dispenser. Our server never greeted us, just approached our table after quite a long wait to order drinks and just started talking super fast. When I asked if there were any specials I couldn't understand anything he said... and I asked him to repeat... same thing. Everyone in my group was super hungry when we arrived after visiting the Desert Museum, and we were looking forward to starting with a pastry but were told they were sold out (we arrived about a quarter to noon on Friday). My mom joked that we were just there ""for Prep, I guess"". I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, and I will credit P&P for delivering an excellent fried chicken, but I'm pretty sure my dish sat under a warmer for a while because my fries were less than fresh.

It's been at least a year since we have dined here, and we used to come quite a bit (Yelp told me I had 18 check-ins when I checked in, so I know I've been there at least 18 times...) and I just don't see a need to rush and return.

The service was excellent. The waitor was very knowledgable and gave a few suggestions. We ordered the duck confit hash and the chicken/french toast. The chicken was tender and juicy and the french toast was to die for. The french toast was made to perfection, flaky, warm and delightful.

I've been in a few times to get takeout and actually bumped the rating up due to how a negative experience was handled and because, while I've been underwhelmed by every drink I've had here, I do appreciate the level of care I've seen them put into making them (such as 7-piece garnish sticks for bloody Marys).

I have rated it as a four star establishment due to its superb food, excellent service and comfortable atmosphere.   I haven't ever given 5 stars to any restaurant since such a rating would suggest perfection.  A bit much to expect from any business.

My decision to upgrade Prep to five-star status came after our visit earlier today.  Today we chose to take a walk on the wild side and stray from our comfort zones.   Each of us ordered a menu item we'd not yet sampled and sadly.....were both dissatisfied.  My girlfriend tried something new to her that (while perfectly prepared) was a bit rich for her taste.  I tried a dish I'd been contemplating for several visits and it was not to my liking.  After further review the manager did mention my breakfast had been poorly executed.  

The thing is, stuff happens!    The restaurant biz is not one w out glitches and at the very high level of quality at which this particular establishment normally functions, it is extremely impressive that they manage to keep constant.
We, of course, offered to pay full price for our meal and the waiter was so kind and apologetic (though he'd done his job perfectly) he disappeared only to return moments later  w the manager.

The two of them approached our table armed w to-go boxes filled with an assortment of scones and cookies a sincere concern in our satisfaction and no bill for our food.

The manager explained how she thought some our food could've certainly been better prepared and she actually used the phrase ""dropped the ball"".  I assured her we'd be back time and time again regardless of our experience this morning.   She was so kind and professional.  We actually left with our scones giggling and joking about how this ""bad"" restaurant experience was actually better than many ""good"" experiences we'd had at other places!!!!

In a small enclosed space like Prep and Pastry, they're a safety hazard, especially if they leave behind any droppings or urine.

5494,4723,1,2,2,0,0,"I was recently invited to this place by my friend because I have heard a lot of good things so I wanted to try it out, we got there and they sat us right away we probably waited five minutes. The waiter didn't come to our table for probably 10 minutes, then we decided to order our drinks and food right away since they took long to come, the drinks came out  fast but the food came out 50 minutes after we ordered it and they brought it out because we asked another waiter about our food , our original waiter never came back to our table, never came back to say sorry for the inconvenience or sorry for the wait, we ended up with another waiter to finish up our transaction. I gave this review two stars because the food was really good but I don't see myself going back to this place  it was just not right the time that we had to wait for our food, when the table behind us got there after us, ate and left and we were still waiting for our food",12/5/2019 2:24
5503,4729,1,5,1,0,0,"Had a great brunch with the girls here...started off with delicious madras mimosas, and for brunch we split quiche, which tasted amazing and I would definitely order again, and the relleno, which is is a large pepper with eggs, cheese, and sauce--so good and was just the right size, so I didn't feel overly full afterwards but also wasn't hungry and needing more.  So much more on the menu looked amazing, I want to go back and try something new!",5/11/2017 3:21
5504,4730,1,5,0,0,0,Well when I say I wish I could do 10 stars I mean it. Such an amazing breakfast/ brunch place with incredible service. The coffee was also great (no picture) The meal was great as well as the price. I can say that I was satisfied and happy after devouring this breakfast. 10/10 I love this place!,7/10/2019 23:33
5512,4736,1,5,0,0,0,"Fast, friendly service. Great, high quality food. You will find cheaper breakfast places in town, but none will offer the same level of quality or creativity.",22/2/2020 14:54
5517,4741,1,4,0,0,0,"This used to be one of my favorite breakfast spots in Tucson but our experience at the new location was just so-so. Perhaps we stopped in on an off day but the quality of the food seems to have diminished. My husband ordered the beni which looked delicious but it was cold & the flavor was somewhat lacking. The lox toast I ordered was very tasty though. 
I was unpleasantly surprised that my coffee & my husband's tea came in disposable cups which seemed odd since we ate in & didn't ask for any to go cups. I noticed at other tables too that every other beverage besides water also came in disposable cups. Seems so wasteful and I hope they stop doing that soon, unless people specifically ask for to go cups!",17/11/2019 19:32
5519,4742,1,5,1,0,1,"Great food and service and ambiance!
We just moved here and have been to P&P twice, both times were wonderful. 
The fried chicken is to die for and love the fresh squeezed juices and pastries ofcourse.
Dom was incredibly welcoming and attentive and made an already great experience even better. 
A big thank you to everyone at P&P!",16/10/2020 20:34
5520,4743,1,1,1,0,0,"Awful experience. I do not know how this place is popular. My wife and I were stared at the entire time and the staff wasn't very friendly. Our food took forever and all we ordered was an omelet that we shared and the coffee was disgusting. I hope for their sake it was just a bad day, but we were very disappointed with this establishment.",6/4/2021 13:34
5524,4745,1,5,11,0,11,"I am a regular at Prep & Pastry. I've tried most of their menu options and I simply love their food. It's delicious! Try the cast iron duck confit, it's my favorite. I also recommend their all hail the omelette & their quiche. SO good. Their drinks are one of a kind and in my opinion beyond compare! They have a large variety of drink options. My favorite mimosa is their prickly pear mimosa and you have to try their michelada. Trust me. The staff is kind and professional. The location is clean and the restaurant proficient. A family friendly restaurant that I highly recommend!",8/8/2020 0:13

5537,4757,1,5,5,2,4,"Oh, man.

Brunch here is phenom.

Great selection of mimosas and cocktails. The entrees are great and the pastries are to DIE for!

Maybe it's a Tucson thing but I love that they will let you do half-orders of entrees. Thus, my quandary of whether to go for the poutine or the Poblano Verde Beni was easily resolved. Both were delicious and not nearly as heavy and filling as I feared.

The poutine was lovely and savory and the beni was delicious. Washed down with coffee and a few mimosas I left both utterly satisfied yet sad to leave. 

The patio is absolutely delightful made even more so by their wonderful servers. Great spot for brunch any day of the week.",31/3/2021 18:30
5541,4761,1,1,1,0,0,"My wife and I were looking forward to brunch. It was our first visit.
What a disappointment!
After 20 minutes our order had still not appeared. When we said we were leaving it suddenly arrived.
The food itself was not appealing at all. My dish was piled with some sort of potatoes, a sausage patty, scrambled eggs and burnt toast all squeezed together on a plate that was not quite large enough to hold it all. Not a very appetizing picture. 
My wife had some sort of a bland, tasteless, peanut butter and jelly concoction that came nowhere near the breathless description on the menu.
All in all there are too many good restaurants in Tucson that serve excellent brunches and breakfasts for one to patronize this one.",9/6/2021 7:41
5543,2714,1,1,2,0,0,"Loved the flavors in the sweet potato hash. And while I will be back, and I am giving the restaurant 4 stars, it is because I believe the food has the potential for 4 stars. 

Here were my wishes for this dish: if the menu says the dish has ""over easy eggs,"" then, while the eggs were over medium and tasty, they SHOULD have been over easy and had some juice. Also, if the menu describes the dish as having ""asparagus, spinach, corn and bell pepper,"" then to qualify as a part of the dish there should be more than two pierces of bell pepper and corn that have to be actively searched for, and the ""asparagus"" should be more than a few pencil eraser sized slices of the discarded portion of an asparagus. No spear. Not enough to claim it. 

However, the three thinly sliced pieces of leek and the few leaves of spinach perfectly added to the delicious flavor of the skin-on roasted sweet potato. 

Our waiter was very nice. He explained the days specials well. However the young lady who delivered our food clearly didn't know her restaurant's menu. When I questioned the over medium eggs, she said that's how the eggs came in that dish. When I informed her the description in the menu called for over easy eggs, she said she could take my meal back and have the eggs redone but that would mean cold hash or reheated hash with soggy spinach .... hmmmm...



UPDATE:

Vegans beware! Their only vegan breakfast is a dried up, hard as a rock chickpea scramble which looks more like burned potatoes with a side of vinegars they try to pass off as a jalapeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½o jelly/salsa. Top it of, for the $12, you'd have about the amoue large egg or a half a small potato. Are you kidding me???? Then you burn it??",13/2/2020 15:37
5544,4762,1,5,0,0,0,I have visited this location 3 times during different visits to Tucson. Wonderful service and fabulous food. We are moving to the Tanque Verde area and I am so happy to see that they have one close to me on Grant. I am sure we will be frequent customers!!,19/10/2019 18:23
5545,4763,1,5,2,0,0,"This is my favorite place to get brunch!! They have the best French Toast, my favorite French Toast is their Green Chili French Toast, it's soo good!! They have the best Grapefruit Mimosas too!! I recommend everyone go to Prep & Pastry in Tucson, AZ!!",26/2/2018 20:24

Also they have a bakery on the side with some goodies to take home .",2/2/2021 3:54
5552,4251,1,5,7,2,2,"Beautiful, bright space.  Delicious food.  Great patio.  What more do you need.  Is this Tucson's best breakfast/lunch spot?  If not, it's close.

The DNA of Prep&Pastry dates back to Amelia Grey's, which inhabited the same great spot.  But after a refresh of the space and menu, Prep&Pastry is all new and raring to go.

It's just opened, and it's worth your time.  You are greeted by a gorgeous array of fresh baked pastries -- scones, muffins, cookies and the world famous ""Don't Call Me a Cronut (I've Been Here For Years)""...I have taken some poetic license with the last one.  But no matter what you call it, who can resist the lovechild of a croissant and doughnut?!

On my first trip the special grilled cheese and roasted tomato soup was perfect to keep the (slight) chill at bay.  A sublime Arnold Palmer with herb tea was a great complement.

On the return trip -- for breakfast on the patio -- we started with coffee, french press tea accompanied by a lemon sage scone and  the obscenely good croissant/doughnut concoction topped with fresh glaze and crisp bacon bits.  From there we moved to fresh, house-made granola topped by yogurt and fresh fruit and the omelet special -- house made sausage, spinach, tomato and cheese. 

They are awaiting a liquor license and a bloody mary bar can't be too far off...

All of the food was excellent.  The service was friendly and well-paced.  You should definitely make this a place to visit.  Perfect for a mid-week lunch or a relaxing weekend breakfast!",7/1/2014 21:22
