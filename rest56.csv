Ordered the king kong. Good god, it was huge. Several meats and a great taste. Recommend it if you love pork. 

Bill wasn't bad, and we will definitely be back. They've earned their stellar rating for a reason. I'm amazed at the breakfast options right here on campbell!",8/7/2017 22:32

My husband and I both ordered the huevos rancheros with brisket, it was definitely delicious and the reason why im giving them such a good rating. Additionally our waitress was very nice and understanding when we sent back the drinks and since she couldn't get the drinks off our ticket, she gave us a complimentary pancake.

Wait time was reasonable but I'm definitely very upset about the bad drinks. We took a Lyft all the way here for them and we're pretty bummed we didn't even get to drink.",15/4/2018 17:53

39766,11425,56,5,3,2,2,"We're big fans of the other Baja Cafe location, and the new location that opened on Campbell needs it's first entry on Yelp, so...here goes.

Great location and a lot of parking, which I envision helping alleviate some of the waits in the surrounding area (and they have stiff competition from Bobo's, Robert's, Prep and Pastry, and Blue Willow all nearby).  Crowded today when we got there, but there were a few open tables and we were seated immediately.  Brad was our waiter, and he was more than polite and a clear fan of the Green Arrow comics/show. He was kind enough to read us the specials, make some small talk about the opening of the new location, and made sure to get everything out to us promptly.  He even went so far as to bring us a complimentary snickerdoodle pancake (admittedly, I've gotten a free bloody mary at the other location, so I feel especially awestruck by the same tendencies to be kind to guests as both locations). It was fan-friggin'-tastic.  Their pancake dough blows my mind -- it's almost like custard filling that's crisped on the outside, and somehow the balance of sugar, frosting, and cinnamon in the snickerdoodle variation just all really works well together.  My partner and I each had our own Yosemite Sam bloody mary, and I was delighted to find that they had all the same fixings from the other location (the jalapeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½o bacon and green chili chicken sausage is just the best thing I've ever had in a bloody mary around town).  Could have used a kick of more garlic, but it was definitely spicy and went well with our more savory items.

To that end, we each ordered some breakfast fare -- my fiancee had their enchiladas and eggs.  They are amazing at the other location, and just amazing at this new locale.  Cheesy goodness and not too much grease despite being filled with chorizo, and the fresh pico was a nice counterpoint in terms of freshness and texture.  I had the benedict special (which I was surprised clocked in at $12.99, as most of their special benedicts seem to hover ar which was based on a karamelo.  I was a bit confused, expecting something more like an open quesadilla, but it had corn cakes that were very similar to their pupusas and in all honestly were probably more in line with what I wanted from the dish anyways.  Black bean sauce, grilled onions, roasted Hatch chilis, queso fresco, pico, and some grilled chicken in an additional sauce, with both red and green sauces sprinkled throughout, made this akin to a New Mexico-Southwestern-style breakfast plate, but one of those unique offerings only available at Baja Cafe.  

In all honesty, we're loyalists to some of the other nearby breakfast joints.  But this new Baja Cafe location means that might be increasingly compromised moving forward, since their food, their staff, and their drinks are all exactly what we crave most Saturday mornings.  Knowing I can hit up Albertson's just a short walk away and score a faculty discount as a means to walk-off breakfast is just all the better.  Can't wait to go back!",23/4/2016 23:27

We were trying all the restaurants in the area, the past reviews were excellent so we decided to give them a try. The menu is great and the omelettes are very very good. We liked the food  so much we came back all the four days that we were staying in Tucson. The Cinnamon French Toast and the Cinnamon pancakes were the best! I would highly recommend for  anyone to stop by for breakfast or any of their other menu items.

39776,121,56,5,1,0,0,"Great breakfast spot! I visited with family on Sunday @ noon & waited about 40 minutes (it was totally worth it). The restaurant provides chairs in the shade. 

The staff run this restaurant like a well-oiled machine. The open kitchen provides guests with a view of the process, an organized chaos. Service was great, our waitress checked-in several times, & our order arrived promptly.

Our table decided to share plates. The benedicts seemed like the thing to get here, so we got the duck confit bene and the special bene. We also tried the snickerdoodle pancake. Everything was top notch, but the duck confit was my absolute favorite. The eggs were poached perfectly. Baja's hash browns are crispy & flavorful.

I usually stay away on Sundays because there's always a wait. However, they have the best Benedict's and I have waited because they are that good! My favorites are the coyote and the wolverine but I've probably ordered the wolverine more. Everything on their menu is a good price.

At the table, we were greeted by Brad who took our drink order and explained the special.  Once he left, we were checked on by another server to make sure someone was bringing us drinks.

39860,6712,56,4,0,0,0,"After trying out the Broadway restaurant, we figured it would be a good idea to give this one a shot before we left town. This time I took a few people with me. 
I'll say that it probably was a 3.5 star visit, but because of the newness/holiday weekend I'm rounding up. (And the fact that Broadway store was amazing and I'm sure they are just getting the glitches out of this new place)
We were told the wait would be about 15 minutes. It was actually 45 which was not a good start. 
We ordered the Wolverine, diamondback, construction burrito, and some other things I don't remember. The food took 35 minutes to arrive. My wolverine was good except the eggs were over cooked and cold. Everything else got rave reviews from my peeps. I didn't send mine back because we had been waiting a while but I'm sure they would have taken care of it. The server was very friendly and attentive. I think they just need to get in the groove with this new place. When I'm back in Tucson I will check them out",31/5/2016 20:53

When our waitress brought the plates out all of our jaws dropped. The portion sizes were huge and looked like a gourmet meal. Since it was our first time eating here were were given a complimentary pancake. Every dish we had was amazing. Our waitress was super helpful in answering all of our questions.

They have a huge menu & you can order anything at any time, which I really like. I don't always want breakfast food for breakfast. The food is actually really good, but I'm noticing that after so many visits there, that I'm getting kinda burned out. There's a weird sort ""sameness"" that I'm experiencing even though it's a diverse menu. I can't really explain it. Probably just a ""personal problem"" but that's why 4 stars instead of 5.

   Bonus points for them not messing up the order, it was completely customized due to my partner not eating any onions, and me not liking any pepppers or anything hot. They did an amazing job, we will most certainly be back.",14/10/2016 22:18
39930,74,56,5,0,0,0,"Baja Cafe is one of my absolute favorite breakfast restaurants of all time. This particular location has a bit better atmosphere than the original location on Broadway and Kolb. Although you can get drinks at either location, this one has an actual bar. It's nice to sit at the counter and eat. It's serving the same great food as the original location, but they have liege waffles whereas the original Baja does not. I haven't tried those, but I've heard they're amazing.

I usually stick with coffee and don't imbibe, but I got a mimosa on my last visit, and it was quite good. I love the snickerdoodle pancakes and will often get the combo with eggs and bacon, so I'm not eating a whole stack of them. I don't have quite that much of a sweet tooth. The corned beef and eggs is another favorite dish of mine. If I get a benedict, I go with the Coyote. It's one of my favorites. The benedicts are all great, but many of them are pushing $16, so I tend to stick with some cheaper options so I'm not spending a huge amount on just me.

I've noticed their prices have increased quite a bit over the last year or so, but I will still continue to come here, because the food is great and I've never gotten bad service, even when they are crazy busy. And they are crazy busy most all weekends! On Saturday or Sunday, expect to wait 20-45 minutes depending on what time you're getting there. The patio is dog-friendly, which is nice.",3/10/2017 22:02

A local friend told me to try their snicker doodle pancake, so we ordered one of those to split to start and looked for something savory to share. When it arrived, we just sat there and stared at it. It was beautiful and cakey with a delicious frosting and covered in cinnamon and sugar...probably the best pancake I've ever had!!! Then we decided to split the goal monster Benedict--- and they should call them benADDICTS because you WILL be addicted after you eat there.

I got their special that day, the  Santa Fe Benedict. Our food came out pretty quick, despite being that busy. And my oh my, my first bite I was in heaven! I told my husband it was like 'food sex'!! It was homemade cornbread, topped with bacon, grilled pork, two perfectly cooked poached eggs, some kind of ancho sauce (sorry, I can't remember what she told me it was) and hash browns on the side. It was so good!! I didn't ask how much it was and I didn't care, it was that good. (Turns out it was $15. A little pricey, but it was totally worth it!) My husband got their Carnivore burger and I knew he liked it when his eyes rolled back in his head after the first bite! He let me have a taste and yeah, it was outstanding! A beef burger with bacon and pulled pork with fries - total protein explosion!

I highly recommend any of the Benedicts and the corned beef and eggs. The corned beef is a perfect blend of sweet and salty with hash browns, eggs and a homemade creamy cheese sauce to top it all off. 

I consider myself to be a biscuits and gravy connoisseur. The B & G here is one of the best ones I've had in Tucson. It is not an instant packet of gravy. Definitely homemade and seasoned well with a lot of sausage. Worth a try.

The service was great, their wasn't any special we knew about it, but thank you for the comped pancake Baja! 

We also got a Benedict, the Wolverine. Once again, first thing I noticed, good presentation, makes you want to take a photo before you cut into it. The way it's stacked, you can take your fork and knife and with one cut, get all the ingredients in one bite!

They were able to seat us quickly whereas other nearby restaurants like Prep & Pastry have taken as long as an hour to get a table ready.  Our server was funny and helpful icials and the best items on the menu.  Food came out quickly and looked incredible.  I don't think anyone had a mediocre meal.  Every dish and cocktail was beautifully prepared and above-and-beyond.  The Yosemite Sam bloody Mary for example included a strip of bacon and turkey sausage.  It was almost a meal unto itself.  I had the pecan roll pancake, corned beef hash, and coffee.  I love these dishes almost to a fault, to the point that I don't want to order any other dishes for fear of missing out.

I want to give this restaurant 5 stars, but keep in mind it's a bit pricey.  To their credit, the portions seemed to be geared toward the uber hungry so the generous quantity may be a factor in the cost.",9/11/2017 19:44

My friend and I stepped outside to finish our conversation since they were closing, and the owner came out to check on us and offered us to-go drinks. I was really floored by the level of care Baja Cafe applies to their customers.

This will definitely be my regular brunch spot even though I live on the NW side of town! Can't wait to return!!",13/11/2016 17:35
40124,792,56,5,1,0,1,"This might be my new favorite brunch restaurant! We had a great experience with excellence service, food, and cocktails. I will be returning to try one of their diverse menu options.

For 11 on a Saturday, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. One was available, but it just had to be finished bussing. My only negative experience was from the host. After a few minutes, she came up to me and told me she thought my whole party was there. I had started drinking a mimosa while waiting for my friends. I told her they would be here any minute, and it would be a group of 3. I was also the only person who entered the restaurant at the time I came in, and I was clearly the only one who sat. I don't know who the invisible 2 people were. I think they should wait to seat you if there is a policy that your entire party must be there before seating. There was no one waiting, and I saw another open table, so I don't know what the issue was. I believe it would be the restaurant's responsibility to enforce that policy, given that I had already ordered and was seated.

Luckily, the service from our waiter was excellent. He chatted to us about dogs when we were sharing pictures of our pets, and he asked if it was our first time in. It was, so he said we would receive a free item from the menu to share as a thank you for coming in. This was really nice! I've never seen a restaurant do this, and I thought it was a nice touch to improve service. 

The menu is very extensive and will please anyone. They had both breakfast and lunch, but I was craving breakfast. However, the lunch menu looked delicious! The breakfast menu has tons of options. You can get traditional eggs, pancakes, biscuits, and french toast combos with your typical sides. There is a page of unique specialties, such as breakfast burritos, chilaquiles, etc. It's definitely a Southwest-inspired menu. I rarely see napalitos on the menu in Tucson, so that was nice to see.

There is an entire page of various Benedicts. These are pricier than other options, but we all ended up ordering one. I ordered today's special, which was a biscuit with sausage, chicken tenders, and sausage gravy with a side of hash browns. Healthy? No. Delicious? Absolutely!! They have such great options that I can't wait to go back to try more.

Their bar is fantastic. I had the mango mimosa, which had mango juice, mango schnapps, OJ, and champagne. The extra kick from the schanpps was much appreciated. I'll easily pay the same for a mimosa with just champagne and much smaller. This came in a very well-sized wine glass. They have several options, plus great cocktails and several Bloody Mary's, if that's your poison.

Try this place. You can get away with spending less than $10 on a filling breakfast or go all out. Either way, you'll have a good experience!",14/8/2016 4:11

If you like eggs Benedict then look no further - the menu has an entire section filled with their specialty benedicts! My personal favorite is the Roadrunner Benedict, which comes on green chile cakes topped with nopalitos. Delicious and unique!

I gave four stars versus five as the service has been slow a few times we have been here - the place is full on the weekends and sometimes drinks from the bar or entrees can take a longer than expected. However, we were given a snicker doodle pancake once when our food took a particularly long time. I don't care for sweet things, so I didn't much enjoy it, but I did appreciate that the staff recognized that the food was taking a while and tried to do their best to make up for it.

The food was really good overall, and you can't go wrong with any of the menu items. The service is great too, the waiter we had while sitting at the breakfast bar was super knowledgeable of the menu and what items to try.

The atmosphere isn't anything out of the ordinary,but they could use more seating outdoors maybe to accommodate the long wait times I have experienced here and there.

Located in the shadow of Old Chicago, few people have noticed it. However, with Baja Cafe's built-in clientele i am confident it will strive here.

Some of the best breakfast in town with delicious pancakes and benedicts and egg dishes with a southwestern flare, Baja Cafe always delivers. Their portions are reasonable and you feel satisfied without being weighed down following a meal.

The huevos rancheros are a delight and the staff is always cordial. In a busy brunch area of town (between prep & pastry and ghinis) i think Baja Cafe can provide a great alternative flavor.",20/5/2016 17:41
40223,3839,56,5,6,5,7,"It seems silly to write up a review because anyone who knows me knows I'm a super fanatical person when it comes to Baja Cafe. I am a missionary taking anyone who hadn't been to Baja Cafe. When the owners told me they were opening a second location, I was over joyed as there would be no chance it would be any further from me than the original on Broadway and Kolb.
The newest Campbell location is roomy and very comfortable. Unlike the original location, it's inherited TV's to watch CNN or sometimes other shows.   I don't like TV's when I'm eating as I can't even force myself to look away( i'm hypnotized into watching like a zombie); so if you like that you are in luck. Especially if you are coming in to sit at the counters, which are a great feature if you are grabbing breakfast or lunch on your own. Baja Cafe on Campbell, has the ability to accommodate larger groups than the original location since the tables aren't fixed. So if you love booths, there aren't any here. Since opening a few short months ago, it seems there are groups of 10 or more nearly every time I dine there now.

So my big concern with the second location opening, was if the food would be as good, since Gerard is such a great cook and the food would be prepared by other cooks. Thus far, every dish has been a winner.
So if you've never been to Baja Cafe, there are the basic breakfast specials ( eggs, meat, side) and then there are great Baja Classics which are their Benedicts and pancakes. There is a special Benedict each week as well as a special pancake for the week; my excitement when I come to eat is what will the specials be, as I want to know all the details! Gerard the chef comes up with great dishes that have creative names: Star Wars weekend themes, Angry Birds Movie premiere weekend dishes, and my favorite was the Bruce Lee Benedict( an awesome low cooked marinated short-rib Benedict).

I get people asking me about when they will have this dish again, which was so good and that the fun and frustration when it's a favorite but not on the regular menu( like the Easter day Benedict; honey ham with balsamic glaze and O'Brien potatoes and asparagus...WIN). That being said, they have great Benedicts on the menu all the time, with an entire page of the menu dedicated to a dozen or so speciality Benedicts you aren't going to find anywhere else. At present I am a huge fan Chris's smoking Benedict, which is first on the list. The smoked beef brisket is just so tender and mouth watering. I've been constantly craving it in the last few  weeks. I've even gotten a pancake, and had to have that brisket on the side; as it's just out of this world. You can order this same great brisket on their Geoff Carnivore burger.
If you haven't tried their pancakes, they make large pancakes, which are light and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Baja Cafe serves a signature snickerdoodle pancake, which has a topping of cinnamon sugar crunch, vanilla drizzle and fluffy Buttermilk pancake inside. So far, every friend I've taken to try it, as had their socks knocked of by this gem. However, I've had out of town guest who just had to have a plain buttermilk with syrup or blueberry pancake; had been delighted every time. 

Lastly and perhaps over looked by me many times but often commented on, is Baja Cafe serves killer hash browns. So basically the staples of a great breakfast can all be found here and are Baja Cafe redefined, as they don't just have bacon they have jalapeno bacon, they don't just have pancakes, they have chocolate lava pancakes with berries n whipped cream. 

In addition, they serve alcoholic beverages which include a spicy Bloody Mary called the Yosemite Sam; that's got jalapeno bacon, pickle and sausage, which gives it all the right moves for me.

Finally, the benedicts are worthwhile as they top it with, once again not that box kind of hollandaise sauce, but the real stuff.

40485,24175,56,5,2,1,1,"I've been looking for the best breakfast in Tucson and thanks to a very delayed flight, I found it! I had heard great things about the east side location, but I just never found the time to drive across town. I happened to check Yelp to help me decide where to have breakfast and discovered the new Campbell location (yeah!). Stopped in to kill time before heading to the airport. We ordered the Duck Confit Benedict, Cinnamon Roll Pancake, Prickly Pear Mimosas and the French Press coffee.

The coffee was probably the best I've had in any town. It's definitely worth the cost of the French Press option!

The Prickly Pear Mimosa was boozy, sweet, and refreshing. Perfect mix of ingredients.

I've made Cinnamon Roll pancakes at home, but it's nice to know there is a place that can rival my version for those days when I don't want to cook. Very tasty!

The Duck Confit Benedict was a religious experience. Tender pieces of duck, perfectly poached egg (which is usually how I judge a breakfast restaurant...this place passes my test), creamy hollandaise with a little spice. Nothing short of amazing.

I will definitely be back! Thank goodness United Airlines can't get anywhere on time. If they hadn't delayed my flight, I would've still had a large breakfast void in Tucson!

As a huge fan of Eggs Benedict, I was impressed with the entire menu page dedicated to southwestern Benedict variations! I got the Five-Alarm Benedict, which came on tamale cakes instead of English muffins. It was pretty tasty, though to be honest I still prefer the traditional Benedict flavor. For Cinco de Mayo, though, it was a fabulous twist. They also have a ton of other creative dishes and I'll definitely be back to try them.

The waiter was kind enough to give us a Snickerdoodle pancake on the house, and it was AMAZING. If you go here, you HAVE to get a Snickerdoodle!

We love the original location, and I'm happy to say that this location is no different!  They're serving up the same delicious, creative, inspired, fresh food.  I tried something new this time, a special, their chocolate lava pancakes.  As usual, the pancakes are quite large.  The batter was fluffy and as advertised -- chocolatey goodness!  The middle was oozing with gooey, flowing chocolate.  The fresh strawberries and whipped cream on top helped break up the richness of the chocolate and really complimented them perfectly.  I also had a side of over medium eggs, and they were cooked to perfection.  I wish they were seasoned a tad, but that's just a minor issue.

The new location is much less cramped.  I like the openness of it.  The decor isn't really exciting or inspired, but it's comfortable enough.  The menu seems to be about the same, with inexpensive classics to creative and tasty benedicts that are worth every penny!  (And their snickerdoodle pancake, which is a *MUST TRY*!)

Been here about 5 times by now, and each time I try to have something new (usually the benedicts and a specialty pancake). Just the other day I was in here and heard they were switching up the menu with some new choices, so guess I'll have to start my ""benedict bucket list"" over, haha. I usually eat a good amount of food, but the benedicts are enough to last two meals easily, so the price is well worth it. 

The restaurant has a very welcoming, home-town feel, and the staff is on top of everything and were very friendly. Seriously, throughout the whole time we were there coffee was refilled before half the cup was ever finished. 

BTW just as many others are saying, the Snickerdoodle pancake is AMAZING, as is/was the chocolate blueberry pancake, and the cinnamon roll pancake. They go especially well with a mimosa, which was equally delicious.

The wait  for the food was about 10 minutes and my Burro came out wrong, it had jalapenos instead of jalapeno bacon which made it far too spicy after the first bite.

She  brought me water & I told her that it was too bad that I came in after the 8 folks to my right. I was very impressed when she instructed my waiter to put my order in ahead of the large table!  I was pleasantly surprised to find a duck confit Benedict on their menu. It was $15+, but it was worth every penny:  loads of duck (a little salty) w/ an interesting array of components; to include several  types of queso, black beans, caramelized onions & it was served over a papusa.  I hadn't ea I was quite hungry, but I ate to my heart's content & I still enough for another meal.  Kim thanked me for my positive comments & offered me a large container of iced water to take w/me!

40839,1426,56,3,1,0,1,"The menu is full of exciting options and people swarm outside of the restaurant like they're making a holy pilgrimage but, when you descend back to reality, Baja Cafe is about 50% decent food and 50% hype. The wait, the crowd, the noise, the strip-mall ambiance, the occasionally stupid prices, and the waitress' request for you to dine-and-dash so that she can free up a table will all bleed the experience of redeeming qualities.

The food would have to be incredible to overcome all of these drawbacks and, while pretty good, it's not half as exciting as the hyperventilating Yelp reviews would have you believe. If you're paying over $16 for a dish of eggs benedict with brisket, the brisket shouldn't arrive looking like the chopped-up remains of a leather jacket. The tamale cakes with nopalitos would only be memorable if you dropped them on the floor--eating them certainly leaves no impression--and the quinoa and sweet potato cakes will leave you feeling healthy in a pleasantly indifferent way. The veggie hangover cure is significantly more fun and large enough to warrant the $12 and food-coma. Those are just a smattering of the more creative items, but if you're looking for a traditional breakfast of diabetes there's plenty on the menu to satisfy your sweet-tooth.

If it wasn't an ordeal to dine at Baja Cafe, many of the reasonably priced dishes would justify an occasional visit. When the hype moves on to another new darling of the brunch scene, Baja Cafe will warrant another appraisal.",5/10/2016 23:54

Okay. So having said the above, my friends and I love Baja. Here's why: even when they are jammed packed and there's a line half way around the block, which happens very often on the weekends they are courteous and give you breathing room to sit enjoy the food or in my case the gossip; the food is always fresh; the options for all our dietary desires are available- vegetarian (you can substitute soy chorizo for any meat in any dish)/ sweet tooth/ salty tooth/ gluten conscious and meat lovers too! The prices here are reasonable not cheap but hey your not being served cheap food so it's fair. Then to round out the five stars the service is friendly and fast. 
My recommendation? Try a different dish each time because I've had at least a dozen and have not found one I don't like yet but I favor the eggs Benedict options. With the turnover rates of customers here of course the coffee stays fresh too. You will not be disappointed.",8/10/2017 19:46

Our server came to our table right away and took our drink orders and asked if we had been there before. We told him that we had not so he said that he would be bringing us a special pancake on the house and that he would be back to describe a few things before we ordered. When he came to take our orders he made some suggestions and then took off to put in our orders. 

Our food came out fairly quickly, but watching all of the tables with their food made me wish that the free pancake came out before the rest of our food. 

I had the corned beef and eggs over hash browns. It came with a gouda sauce on it that I didn't like. I told the server that I did not remember seeing the sauce on the menu. Rather than argue with me about whether it was on there, he simply offered to get me a new one. The portions are very generous and the food is freshly prepared. My husband had some sort of pork and eggs dish and he loved it and our friend had a huge helping of french toast. 

Our free pancake was a snickerdoodle with vanilla icing on it. It was good, and I'm glad that we got to try it, but I think that the other main courses were preferred by all 3 of us. 

There have been several different restaurants in this location over the years, but I'm confident that this one is here to stay. It was crowded and we had a short wait, but that just means it's worth waiting for. We will definitely be back to sample some other things from the menu.

This was an accurate observation. I had the chilaquiles with green sauce. I was dubious when I saw what looked like grocery store tortilla chips, but looks aren't everything. As they should be, the chips were just stale enough to be ideal for the dish. The sauce was tangy and not overbearing.

That said, be careful of the sneaky up charges and tactics to get you to spend more. I was in for breakfast today and there were two that appeared without much expectation. I had the snickerdoodle pancake special and upgraded to Chipotle Bacon (a $1 up charge). When offered to me I didn't realize it was an upgrade however. My server simply gave me my breakfast meat options, I selected the Chipotle Bacon and didn't think twice about it til there was an extra charge on my bill. It is common courtesy for the server to let the diner know that it's an extra charge. I would have even still ordered it, but been less surprised at the end. Additionally there was a $.01 round up charge to bring my bill to an even $15. Again, not a big deal but sorta sneaky. 

It's happened multiple times before and to my dining partner today as well. Examples mostly with a side of breakfast breads. Server says, ""would you like toast with that?"" with no mention of an up charge. 

Lastly, the servers constantly try to up sell on cocktails and other sides/deserts/specials and seem discontent when you say no. I get it, they make money on the added charges, but it's obnoxious and is likely to drive even the most loyal customers away.",18/2/2017 19:11

Variety - check, something off the beaten path... check.  Prices, actually pretty reasonable imho for what you get.  The place is causal, everything from young families to young professionals noshing after an evening's festivities together.  As for what we had, it was my first time so I had to make sure that they had the basics covered, so I just did a traditional bennie.  It was great, ham seared, eggs poached just right and the sauce was what it should be.  The hash browns lightly cooked, not too crispy (tyvm).  A nice coffee carolan to start the day was welcome.  The better half has the french toast and eggs, which she declared awesome as well as the cinnamon bread was used in the french toast.  The flavor was just right, eggs looked like they were made fresh as opposed from retrieved from the previous hours batch makings.

The service was prompt and unobtrusive, looked like the manager even swung by to check on us as a touch base, which was also just right.

I'm from Chicago and am just visiting Tucson for a short while. Someone recommended i try Baja Cafe for brunch, and also recommended that i try one of their AMAZING eggs benedict menu items. I decided to try it (even though i hate runny eggs) and i was NOT disappointed. 

I ordered the falcon and immediately my mind was blown. The smoked chicken and chorizo worked together with the chile and the eggs in such a unique way. I've never tasted anything that good (hence, the yelp account and review lol).

But, not only is the food excellent, the staff was also really friendly. My waiter was so attentive and helpful. And i was really surprised when he brought me a complimentary snickerdoodle pancake because I told him I was visiting from Chicago. That pancake was also mind blowing btw. Soooo good!

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is the ambiance is lacking. It's very loud, and at times you feel like you are sitting on top of each other. The service can be a bit slow on weekends, because they are always slammed.  So arrive with you patience and you will be rewarded.",4/10/2016 15:22

Wow. This is my new favorite place.  The Bloody Mary's are yummy.  The Huevos Rancheros were far better than Teresa's mosaic...and they beat Bobby Flay!! The Roadrunner had so many veggies it was impossible to finish.  And we did not try what they are apparently known for - their amazing pancakes.  This will def be a go to place from now on. The service was excellent and a team effort.  If I could give 10 star I would but I will give the maximum of five.

41329,3714,56,5,4,0,3,"Baja Cafe is a must-try breakfast/lunch stop in Tucson. Their menu, specializing in variations of eggs Benedict and pancakes, have a wide variety of items on their menu. As you can read from the many reviews here, Baja Cafe does them all right.

I had the ""Anomaly"" eggs Benedict. Here's the description:

Mac and cheese waffles placed over a tomatillo green chili sauce. Topped with a combination of julienne bell peppers,  fire roasted green chilies, caramelized onions and our house smoked habanero chicken sausage. Finished with poached eggs, smoked gouda cheese sauce and pico de gallo.

Yes, did you read that? ""MAC AND CHEESE waffles."" Did you oooh and aaah at that description? I did, too. That's why I ordered it. Bonus--since it was my first time there, I got one of their famous Snickerdoodle pancakes gratis. The Anomaly was tasty. The mac and cheese waffles were interesting and gave a good flavor balance. Because of the chilis, this meal definitely has a kick to it. Baja Cafe really does a poached egg right. The yokes were perfectly creamy. The whole eggs were nicely oval all the way around, not flattish as you would have a poached egg done in your pan at home.

It also comes with a side of hash browns. I'm pretty picky with my hash browns and these were excellent. The Snickerdoodle pancake was amazing. Not too sweet.

The service was great. Our waiter was friendly, informative, and attentive. The lighting was surprisingly dark. It was dark. You get used to it.

I would go back just for the poached egg. But I look forward to trying many of their other menu items.

5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.
4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.
3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.

Baja Cafe on Campbell is easily one of the best breakfast places in Tucson, and one of my favorite restaurants. I have been here well over a dozen times, and have never had a single bad experience. The service is always phenomenal, everyone always seems like they genuinely want to take care of you (little things like noticing your coffee is almost empty while they're walking back with an almost empty coffee pot and telling you that they'll be right back with a new hot pot for you), and the food is great 100% of the time. After this place first opened, I think I was there at least once for breakfast every week for 8 weeks. I have brought at least a dozen friends here, mostly those who had left Tucson for a short period and had come back to visit, and every single one of them loved it.

My only complain I guess is that there are only two bathrooms with a restaurant that is pretty often packed, so all that free coffee can get ya. Otherwise, come here and enjoy yourself. Make sure to tell them it's your first time - you're in for a treat.

There is a daily special, which sometimes reflects the events going on around Tucson, such as graduation. There are the traditional classic breakfast menu items, but then there are some special twists.

However, I knew I also had to commit to trying at least one restaurant that I never previously had the chance to try. I simply cannot try all these new places, so I knew I had to find somewhere that was generating a lot of buzz. This is what led me to Baja Cafe. 

This apparently is their second location. It is nested inside the major shopping center at Glenn and Campbell. Let me tell you that it was amazing. Yes, this would have been a place Glenn Campbell himself would have enjoyed. 

The atmosphere is modern diner style. UofA basketball photos on most of the walls; some of them bringing me back to my younger days with pictures of Salim Stoudamire and Andre Iguodala. On each table there is French's Ketchup, two hot sauces, and artificial sweeteners. 

On this visit, I had the green chili enchiladas. The tortillas they use are freshly made from La Mesa Tortillas in town. The flavor of the whole dish was delicious. the green chillies was the best part. 

I had some bits of the black bean burger, and wow was that tasty. It had their homemade sauce and mushrooms and spinach were key toppings that made it what it was. 

Then, I had the Snickerdoodle pancake. It was on the first bit that I realized that Baja Cafe is in a league of its own. You absolutely must get this pancake. It was so amazing you do not need syrup. Just get it and eat it. 

For it's unique menu, UofA basketball environment, and one-of-a-kind food, I am giving this place the maximum five stars. Don't wait as long as  I did. Go to one of their locations and enjoy.",27/11/2017 23:04

I was waffling over a drink, since they have margs, a bunch of different mimosa varities, and bloodies, and the waitress told me they were voted best bloody in AZ. After basically sucking the whole thing down in 5 minutes, I would also cast my vote. It's peppery and thick and made me want 6 more. 
I ordered The Stack, which is some sinful mashup of crispy hash browns, breakfast ham (the best ham), bacon, an egg (get it over easy) and love. Seriously the best breakfast dish I've ever had, I saw stars and heard Drake. 
My boyfriend got the infamous snickerdoodle pancakes and I legitimately smelled them the second the waitress stepped outside with the plate. The frosting on top looks divine and it's so fluffy, you're gonna die.

It was not particularly busy at that time (it was brunch time in the middle of the week) and the waiter was attentive at the beginning. Towards the end as the restaurant filled up for lunch, it did take us a little bit to get our bill but still not so long for me to get irritated.

My friends went with waffles and a burger which they seemed to enjoy. I decided to go with Mikes Duck Confit 3.0. Overall, it was decent. Loved the duck flavor; the poached eggs were nice and runny inside; the arepas had a good flavor but a little dry; the hollandaises/bean sauce were good but I wish I had more on the arepas and eggs; and I could have used some extra heat from the green chilies and chipotle hollandaise (but I like extra heat in general).

Since I was a college student 35 years ago, I have loved breakfast restaurants - any and all kinds that had snappy service, quality comfort food, and coffee.  The Baja delivers these - big time.
I have visited both Baja cafes, and you get the same great food at each location and both provide comfortable, enjoyable, but distinct vibes.

The Baja on Campbell is an intoxicating, modern vision of the classic breakfast diner.  Busy, with a touch of hipster cool, but not so much that you drown in the irony.  

The menu has all that you want - all that you need.  And then some.  
The vast array of different forms of Eggs Benedict is awe inspiring, creative, tasty, and filling.  I have only had 3 or 4 different types of the Benedicts (all really good), but now that I have tried the HOMEMADE corned beef hash, I have found my go to brekky here.  High quality beef brisket and caramelized onions, over hash browns.  Add the secret sauce, drop a couple poached eggs on top and you are golden.  Ab Fab.

There was a wait, but no big deal. It was nearly noon on the Fourth of July. What was really a nice surprise was that there were folding camp chairs set up out front to sit in while you wait. (I dug my paperback copy of ""Lucky You"" by Carl Hiaasen and read while we waited. If you haven't read Hiaasen, you're missing out. He's a comic genius. Anyway.)

I had the Trainwreck, which is crazy delicious. It's a green chili tomatillo sauce, hash browns, sausage, bacon and ham, lots of veggies (I ordered it without mushrooms but I got a few anyway. Not a national crisis.)

My husband had one of the Benedicts, which they are rightfully famous for. My husband had the Leprechaun - toasted English muffin, herb cream cheese, corned beef, spinach, mushrooms with poached eggs and a smoked Gouda cheese sauce that he rhapsodized over. As he was eating it, he told me that he now understood why I say that sometimes I say I'll dream about a particularly good meal. I cannot remember the last time he was that excited about food. 

I can't remember the last time I *wasn't* this excited about food. 

Our waiter was great. I can't remember his name, although I'm sure he gave it to.us. He apologized profusely about the mushroom situation, kept our drinks full, and was just the right balance of professional and friendly. 

Do I like this location better than the one on east Broadway? I can't say. I'm pretty sure that we need to eat at them both again to decide which is better.

Not worth having my plate of food whisked away for. The people at the next table were experiencing egg problems too and one diner had her plate taken.

I don't understand why servers don't just leave you with some food to nibble on while the offending item is re-prepared. Does the cook trust them so little that they won't make it again without laying eyeballs on the evidence ? It seems a poor policy if you're trying to make your guests comfortable. I digress.

My favorite item to order here is the construction burro since you can add quite a bit of different items to it, and it tends to cost less than getting a specialty burro then adding additional add-ins to it. I highly recommend trying your burro enchilada style from here. I try to make my breakfast burro as vegan as possible and they are very accommodating to that here. For any vegans out there though, if you are a very strict vegan just be aware their tortillas are not vegan. In addition to their great food, their mimosas are so good and they are a must try.

We were in town for the weekend, just wrapping things up on Monday morning to drive back home up north. Found a few breakfast places on Yelp, but most had a limited breakfast menu after 11am. Not Baja Cafe! They have a whole page dedicated to a Benedicts, so that made our decision. 

Husband had the Coyote Benedict. I opted for a special of Eggs & Georgia Peach French toast (came with choice of sausage or bacon, hash browns). We also each had a coffee, and we ordered our toddler the scrambled eggs with cheese, with sausage on the side, from the kids menu. 

We polished off our plates. Every one of us. Our son wasn't feeling well, but he ate every bite of sausage and scrambled eggs. Their hash browns are PERFECTLY crisp, not soggy at all, and we didn't even have to ask for them to be extra crispy. Their coffee was delicious (I requested and received a to-go cup). Their eggs were perfectly cooked. The bacon I got was a little on the floppy side, but flavor-wise was good. Husband loved his Benedict. 

We all left with full stomachs and happy faces. It's the best feeling to stumble across a gem like this place on Yelp.

I had the pulled pork burrito, enchilada style with green sauce. It was honest-to-God one of the tastiest burritos I've EVER had. If you're feeling HANGRY, this is the meal to get. It had a bit of everything in it and it satisfied all my cravings.

Their benedicts are amazing, and with an eclectic menu, you honestly can't go wrong with whatever you end up ordering. 

The restaurant was able to accommodate our large graduation party, as well as a few others with their indoor and outdoor seating. Don't be surprised by at least a 20 minute wait though, this place is already poppin, presumably from the lack of actual good brunch options in Tucson. 

I ordered the Zeke's escape benedict, and omg was it a flavorful explosion. The shrimp was perhaps the best part of the dish, and their was plenty of it, along with 2 perfectly poached eggs, tamale cake, sausage, veggies, and hashbrowns. I have to say this was perhaps the best benedict on the menu and maybe in my life. It's southwestern meets cajun all in one plate. I was really glad I didn't order the duck confit benedict, since it definitely lacked in tenderness and flavor.

The service experience alone would definitely get 5 stars. Our server was polite, brought out snickerdoodle pancakes on the house, and was constantly at our large table to heed our every beck and call.

If I had anything to complain about, it would be about their Bruce Lee benedict special. I mean, just because you have a benedict that incorporates sriracha and soy sauce, doesn't mean you automatically have to call it Bruce Lee. The same could be said about Zeke's escape.

I was especially thrilled because they had the option to substitute tofu for eggs in any of the dishes - not just one special dish, but anywhere you wanted it!  (Not that I imagine poached tofu is a good sub, but I suppose they would let you try).  I'm sensitive to eggs, so breakfast out has become insanely difficult.  If you REALLY look at breakfast menus and try to avoid eggs, you'll find your options dismal at best.  So, having Baja Cafe, where I can get huevo-less-ranchero or even just a plain old not-eggs, bacon and hashed browns is reason to celebrate!

Aside from this marvelous discovery, I was pleased to learn that their signature pancakes are actually delicious!  I was worried that they'd be super-super sweet, with names like snickerdoodle promising oozing icing and over the top batter.  In fact, they are light, fluffy (okay, amazingly fluffy) and very flavorful - without going into sweet overdrive.  Marvelous!

The rest of the flavors were very good.  My tofu breakfast tacos were delicious, with soyriso as a tasty option if I were vegan (eew).  Portion sizes are very generous, which is good because the prices aren't too bad.  

Next time, I'll try to enjoy the mimosas or many Bloody Mary type concoctions.  

Lost 1 star for the decor - I just felt like it was trying to be a hip bar, but in the garish light of Sunday morning, it just looked over the top and uncomfortable.

I simply told her that I ordered them over well and she didn't even let me finish my sentence, rolled her eyes, put her hand up at me and walked away with my plate while I was in the middle of finishing my sentence. Had she let me finish what I was saying, she would have known there was no reason to wisp my plate away because I would have just skipped the eggs and given them to my dog.

Both reviewed a restaurant without even trying the food. So, been a while since I've been there since I live in Phoenix, but last time I was there, it was busy. Why? Because they're good. 

The first time I went got the Black Widow and normally I'm a traditional benedict guy, but this looked too insane to pass up. It doesn't taste like a benedict, but all the flavors work great together and runny yolk from the poached egg adds that extra deliciousness to this creation.

The next time I went I got the Brisket Papusas. Because Papusas for breakfast! Again, runny poached eggs make it extra special. Never thought of having a Papusas this way, but again, it totally works! 

If you're not vegan or too stupid to understand the policy of giving up a full table to have someone wait 30 min for their party to arrive in the middle of a rush, then you'll love this place!

The one thing that started to be an issue was the rude and incompetent hostess. There is always a wait midmorning and the front gets crowded so sometimes we have to sit away from the door. However,  the hostess barely calls out your name once and if you don't hear her she moves on. She never greets you and seems to always have a bad attitude. That is seriously one of the biggest reasons I've stayed away recently! I've complained about her and nothing has changed. The rest of the staff there seems great and attentive.

At first the menu looks like jerry bobs restaurant, you know, like ordinary American breakfast stuff, but they do have some unique items like the Black widow vegetarian option which I ordered. 
The black widow tasted pretty good I must say. The crispy pastry layer put it over the top. 

But it comes at a cost which unfortunately most American breakfast do. This one is no different, very oily and greasy. It tasted good but left me feeling a bit nauseated at the end. I didn't finish all that was served, the portion was large but also because it was greasy...",27/9/2019 17:18

The food is delicious! They have a huge range of egg Benedict's, which are my favorite to get when I come here! The omelets are huge, very filling but less tasty compared to the Benedict's. The PANCAKES are what make this place special. For first time comers, they often give a free snickerdoodle pancake, it's creamy, thick, moist, and tastes amazing like cake almost.

It was Saturday morning - there were about 20 people ahead of us.  We were told the wait was 20 minutes which I thought was great considering.  As one of the customers passed us,  he stopped and asked us if it was our first time there.  Since it was, he raved about it,  told us that the wait was worth it and gave us a few recommendations.  We were seated in 15.  The waiter greeted us right away and took our drink order.  He was back in less than 5 minutes with our drinks - which by the way were great.  I had the mimosa,  my husband had the bloody mary (should have ordered the Bloody Mary - it was excellent).  

Then the food came in less than 10 minutes - really amazing considering the place was packed.  I had the coyote benedict.  Wow.  Just wow.  The list of benes was impressive with very cool combinations.  My husband ordered the typical bacon and eggs - except the bacon is not typical.  It was excellent.  Then he ordered the cinnamon roll pancake.  To die for.

First, read the description because they are not a light fluffy waffle.  The waffle is heavy and bread like.  Second, do not be turned off you only get two.  They are very filling and two were more than enough for a hardy breakfast.  Finally, be prepared for them to be chewy.
None of the items are bad as long as you are in a mind set you are not getting a waffle like other places.  I liked the taste.  The waffles were a nice balance of sweetness.  I finished both and probably should have taken one home because they are very filling.  It did remind me a a sweet bread.

42555,964,56,5,9,0,5,"Now that Baja Cafe has opened this second location in central Tucson, I no longer have an excuse as to why I don't go more often. Obviously the first location was such a success that opening this one was a must! Much like their original location- Baja Cafe on Campbell is all about the food- as it should be! In a town that's peppered with concept driven restaurants that seem to place higher value on decor rather than delicious, well executed food and great customer service, Baja Cafe is a breath of fresh air. 

The place is busy, folks! Even at 1pm on a Saturday. There is outdoor seating, but during the hot summer months most folks opt for indoor, so it looks like it fills up quick. I might suggest heading there early to avoid a long wait and to ensure you don't miss out on some of the dishes. They had run out of a few items by 1pm on a Saturday. I don't have kids, but I did notice they have a small play area with toys and dinosaurs to keep kids entertained while families wait for a table- nice touch!

Breakfast lovers can rejoice in the fact that they serve breakfast all-day. The menu offers a ton of choices too. There are over ten Eggs Benedict variations to choose from and over five pancake flavors and that's just one part of the menu! All of the breakfast staples are available at Baja Cafe but with a twist. They even manage to include a special Egg Benedict and special pancake flavor every week. Follow them on Facebook to keep up with their special rotations. 

As mentioned- the menu is big, so if Eggs Benedict and Pancakes aren't your jam, fear not- Baja Cafe has you covered- from chilaquiles to breakfast tacos, croissant breakfast sandwiches to build your own mac & cheese, burgers and brisket....you will find it all.

The cocktails are just as inventive as their food items and reasonably priced. I say, go for the Bloody Mary.

I ended up getting the papusa dish and every single thing about it was amazing. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a breakfast as much as I enjoyed this. The hash browns were out of this world too- I have no idea how they make them but they had so much flavor and were crispy without being crunchy.

The Eggs Benedict were tiny and short on the hollandaise. The hash browns were cooked well on one side and barely at all through the rest. The plate looked like something from Denny's. To be honest, I was shocked. Additionally, the last two or three visits I've made were merely acceptable and nowhere near the high level of expectations I'd built with the place.

This cake was the feature that made Baja Cafe unique among Tucson's many excellent breakfast places.  We asked our server and she just said they don't offer it anymore; no explanation.

They had a huge breakfast menu, but what caught my attention was the extensive list of benedict options - I must've died and went to heaven! 

I ordered The Leprechaun, which was phenomenal. It had corned beef in it, which is already a winner in my book. My fiancee had The Tombstone, which had a TexMex flair, but was also delicious (I snagged a bite or two). My cousin ordered I believe what was called 'Welcome Home', which instead of an english muffin, it was supplemented with a tamale style pancake; MINDBLOWING!

42742,1803,56,5,1,0,0,"So, we came over here with some friends this morning for brunch. My friend's boyfriend had never been here, and to be totally honest I think the huge group of people waiting outside alarmed him. But it gave the rest of us plenty of time to study the specials board, which featured an ""adobada magic"" Benedict (more on that joker later!) and an orange creamsicle pancake, which sounded yummy (but I'm not a sweet breakfast kind of person.) 

The two gentlemen in our group decided on the adobada magic bene before we even got seated. Now with that being said, Baja Cafe is (as far as I'm concerned) hands down the best place to get a creative Southwestern breakfast in this town. The adobada magic had chorizo and green chile in the mashed potatoes (what kind of genius culinary badass thought of that?!), pork adobada, onions, cheese, fried onions on top...all kinds of deliciousness. 

My friend and I both got the Boss Hog. Another fantastic choice. It was a grilled buttermilk biscuit with bacon, chicken tenders, a smoked Gouda sauce (that was so good I wanted a Big Gulp full of it, no joke!) and finished with sausage gravy. As my friend kept saying as she ate hers, ""I would have never thought to put chicken tenders in this but it's so good!"" AGREED. 

DH shared odd bits of his bene with me - a piece of adobada pork, some bacon that had been chilling out in the delicious adobada sauce. It was delicious. 

And to end with a quote from my friend's boyfriend, ""Holy smokin' Toledo, that was the best breakfast I've had in a long time!""

42745,882,56,5,8,7,8,"One of my favorite things about my best friend coming to town is that I get to listen to her diatribes about food. While I'm the sort of heathen who shoves food in my mouth and mumbles ""food good. fire pretty,"" my friend actually chews and tastes her food like a civilized being. She is something of a finicky eater because her palate is very sensitive and I am convinced she is a super-taster, food-texture extraordinaire. I dare you to try and sneak in 0.00000000000000000000005 oz of a spice she doesn't like into a dish - she. will. know. 

The point is, this particular friend is very choosy and peculiar about the food she enjoys--the most enthusiastic  post-meal platitude you can usually finagle out of her is a resigned, ""It was okay."" At Baja, she leaned back and said in a very impressed tone, ""Everything was really good."" Let me point out this is the equivalent of me politely setting my fork down, daintily dabbing my mouth with my napkin, then jumping up and yelling across the room, ""That was so fucking good give me more now!!!!!!!!!""

So. Yes. What I mean to say with that long preamble is that Baja Cafe is seriously a gem. It is a totally unpretentious, unassuming breakfast/brunch joint that serves delicious and creative food. Expect a wait! Ours was about 45 minutes. However, the food was WORTH IT. 

My picky friend and I split a snickerdoodle pancake and the duck confit benedict. That snickerdoodle pancake is TO. DIE. FOR. I am usually very hesitant to order pancakes at breakfast joints because 1) I prefer savory meals and 2) I am always worried the pancake will be too dense, sweet, and oily. My supertaster best friend was also dubious, thinking it would be too sweet. We both were completely dead wrong. The snickerdoodle pancake was a mildly sweet, audaciously addictive, shockingly light and puffy fluff cake magicked straight from heavens. The creamy icing added the PERFECT amount of sweetness to it. My super taster BFF remarked that she has never been able to figure out how to make pancakes that fluffy and kept asking me how they did it, like she thinks I know what I'm doing with my life (hint: I don't). Either way, we devoured our pancake and now I am dreaming of eating a stack of them.

Our next dish: the duck confit eggs benedict. WTF, Baja? This dish was TO. DIE. FOR (Volume 2). While I can't find an updated menu with the description of this dish online, it is 2 poached eggs served with duck brined for like days served on top of an arepa with green chili, black beans, bacon, and other cheeses and goodies. Ours was covered by a red and green sauce- I think one was a chipotle hollandaise and the other one was avocado-based? It was served with a side of hash browns. Ohmygodthisdishwassomothereffinggood. My super taster BFF literally could not add ketchup to her hash browns because while usually hash browns + ketchup = complementing deliciousness, the hash browns were already perfectly seasoned that ketchup detracted from the flavor. Seriously? How does one literally render ketchup in hash browns redundant??? The arepa was also rich, corny, sweet, dense goodness. My recommendation is to not do what I did, which was deconstruct the dish and try each individual component, because the brined duck is too salty alone. Eat everything as one heavenly bite. I SWEAR. The flavors go together PERFECTLY. SO SO SO x10000 good.

Okay. I'm tired of writing now. In summary, for those of you reading Yelps as you wait for a table, my advice is to: 1. Order a pancake. I don't care if you feel like you don't want/can't finish it--split it with your group. WORTH IT. 2. You cannot go wrong with any variation of eggs benedict. That is all. Enjoy.",29/12/2016 19:09

But on to the food. It's delicious and amazing and worth putting up with the music. I had the Hangover Cure and it takes breakfast to a whole new level when you introduce smoked brisket into the mix. 

My fiancï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and I are gonna come back for cocktails some day, I just hope they take notice and ditch the music.

I love it.  Was there this past Monday for mid morning breakfast and it was packed. Who would have thought on a Monday.  

I am basic, bacon (delish), eggs, maybe a plain pancake or french toast.  Since my friend was a first timer, they brought us a free sample size Snickerdoodle pancake.  It's a great desert, too sweet for me as a main course but so good.  This happened at the east side Baja when I was there once too.  
Servers are usually really nice and work their buns off.  This weeks guy was excellent.  Stopped to see how we were doing every time he passed by.  He was busy too.  

My friend had one of the eggs benedicts and did not leave a morsel on her plate.  There is a whole page of benedicts on the menu.

I have been to all 3 locations and like Campbell the best just because it holds more people.  The food has been amazing at all locations.
They have outside seating with heaters if its chilly.  Inside, when full, can be loud but my friend, who wears hearing aids which sometimes make it hard to hear when loud,  and I had no problem talking. 

Going back this Sunday with some others who have never been, lets see if we get another free Snickerdoodle.  And I will be able to have a Bloody Mary since its my day off.  They always look really good too.  Can't wait.",22/3/2019 16:10

Answer to the rude manager: apparently you were also out of customer service today because strawberry fuzz doesn't come an inch long.

Had heard great things about the breakfast here, so we decided to meet our mother there a little early to beat the Sunday rush. Mom was running a few minutes behind. No big deal, we had come early to secure a table anyway so thought we could sit down and have a few cups of coffee while we waited. We were told by the hostess that parties that were not complete could not be seated, with the rationale that the table could be occupied for an hour or more while others waited to be seated. True, that could happen, and probably does. However, I think this policy has less to do with other customer's wait times and more about the business just being straight-up greedy. What a turn-off. 

I have heard of other restaurants starting to do this in bigger cities, and that they are beginning to get away with the practice. Yeah, no.

First: COME HUNGRY

The portions are generous & so delicious you won't want to stop eating. In addition to the classic huevos rancheros (with soy chorizo) I also got a bonus snickerdoodle pancake. The pancake was SO SWEET (in a good way) but.i wanted something a little more savory to go with my prickly pear mimosa. 

Second: GO EARLY 

This place is bumpin. You may have to wait a bit but the turn over is usually pretty quick. Also, they run out of the chilaquiles so you want to go early enough to get them. 

Third: BRUNG YOUR DOGGIE FRIEND

This was the best meal I've had at a restaurant in town for some time. We ordered a serious spread and every single thing was great.

Bloody Mary: spot on.
Irish coffee: delicious and generously boozy
Snickerdoodle pancake: as great as everyone says. I don't order pancakes at restaurants as a rule. They are generally a fluffy, stuffing waste o' money. But these were really worth a try. Not as a pancake, but a delicious breakfast dessert.
Biscuits and gravy: YES. Maybe best ever. 
Special Benedict (something with pupusas and I don't know what): rocking. 

Our server was a little over-extended, and I could have used a bit more browning on my hash browns, but that's all I can criticize.

Service was helpful and prompt.

I had the Wyatt Earp Benedict.  OMG - I am a big guy with a monster appetite, and I couldn't quite keep my membership in the Clean Plate Club.  The poached eggs were cooked perfectly, the bacon nice and crisp, and the green chile sauce and tamale pie underneath was wonderful

My wife had the Liege waffles - I had always heard about them but never had a chance to taste them before.  I thought they were excellent - I nice crisp on the outside, velvety soft and flavorful on the inside with a perfect sweetness level.

However, this establishment is buzzing and for good reason.  Just take a look at all the football players that eat here -- if you want to get filled up, it's the place to be.  On top of that, if you're kinda a foodie you also won't be disappointed.  I'm most impressed with its loyal staff and smiling, attentive service, which takes fortitude considering the amount of tables they get through in a short amount of time, and I can say they all look happy to be working there.  And if there's a wait, it's not long, and since you can hang outside, it's not overly unpleasant.  So I'd suggest they have free self-service coffee for those that wait, like I've seen in some other popular breakfast places around the country, but aside from that, other successful breakfast places could also take a nod from Baja and see that kind, respectful service with consistently good food with healthy portions is possible, and is the recipe for success.  I can't think of anything negative, but 5 stars requires something beyond my expectations and maybe we're not there -- but I've got no complaints.  I suppose one thing is the location.

I had ""the anomaly"" and my friend had ""the flash."" Oh My! An Eggs Benedict made with waffles, Mac & Cheese, tomatillo, machaca, chili, bacon, poached eggs, Gouda..... ARE YOU KIDDING ME? There was more flavor in this massive plate of food than anything I've eaten in awhile.
The key point of my review however is about the service... so incredibly enthusiastic, attentive and most surprisingly... knowledgeable.
This guy's name was Nick. When Nick found out it was our first time in he proceeded to take us on one of the best verbal menu tours I have ever witnessed. Not only did he tell us about a handful of his favorites but he left out no detail or ingredient and truly was impressive in his descriptions! His attentiveness was spot on, extremely outgoing and just did an all around fine job. I'll admit when I walked in I wasn't expecting such knowledge and skill from a server in a casual place like this.

First, I couldn't believe my total was $12! I asked one of the employees to double check that they rang me up for both orders and she confirmed that, yep, 2 huge pancake orders was $12. Boo-Yah!

When we got home and tried the pancakes, I ran to grab my phone (while holding the container with the pancake in it so that I could sneak bites in while I write) so that I could write this review. 

The pancakes are so good! Jesus be a respirator because I am so taken aback with how good the pancake is. Sweet, fluffy, huge, and doesn't need additional syrup.

This is a true mom and pop breakfast spot and has a cute diner feel to it. They are known for their eggs Benedict's (they have a whole page of them to choose from!) but that's not my style so I tried the best of both worlds: eggs with bacon and a waffle. The waffle was amazing!!! It was one of those liege waffles that are made from dough instead of batter and I wanted like 5 more(even though it was pretty filling since it's a dough)! Everything we ordered was great and since it was our first time, they brought us a snickerdoodle pancake on the house and omg you guys, this was the bees knees. It was huge and covered in frosting.

For lunch, one of us had the pulled pork tacos and I had the smoked chicken enchilada.  The enchilada had both red and green sauce.  The red sauce was pretty spicy so good idea to make sure you have some water to have when you need it.  The smoked chicken had a nice smoky flavor and there was a nice portion of cheese included.  The included calabacitas had a lot of flavor as well.

For breakfast on Saturday, there were four of us.  They were pretty crowded and only outside seating was available.  They don't seat you until the whole party is there so plan to arrive together.  The outside seating was okay but it was chilly even with the heaters going.  It's a good idea to take a good jacket if you might seat outside.  The table is wrought iron and not covered with anything so I wouldn't want to put my silverware directly on it personally.  Placemats would be a nice touch.

Since it was the first time for two of our party, they brought the complimentary snickerdoodle pancake (we weren't offered it the other day) so be sure to ask for it.  It's quite good.  I had the liege waffles with a blueberry compote, fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  I really liked the taste of the compote with the waffles.

Craving sweet?
Based on previous reviews, I decided to try one of their specialty pancakes, and it was soo worth it (thank you, fellow yelpers!). I had the eggs and pancake combo (to also get something savory) which came with 2 eggs any style, a side of crispy bacon (you can also choose ham or sausage), hashbrowns, and a strawberry pancake. The strawberry pancake was amazing - caramelized with strawberry brown sugar so a bit of crunch in the fluffy pancake and topped with fresh strawberries and vanilla bean glaze. Great balance of textures and flavors. 

Craving savory?
The huevos rancheros are huge - 2 tortillas with black beans, cheese, red and green sauce, and 2 eggs any style. The pico de gallo and avocado add a nice freshness and lightness. My husband has had the corned beef which he enjoyed, but his favorite so far is the brisket carmelo benedict - topped with fire roasted green chiles, pico, and a smoked gouda cheese sauce and red chile sauce that added a nice mixture of flavors.

For Campbell, if you want a more contemporary seating area, come to this place. I would come here right when they open, since this place is no secret, good.

I've gotten two variations of the eggs benedict. The Black widow and Mike's duck confit both savory and totally unique takes on the beni. The widow had artichoke hearts and fried onion, sweet and tart tones. While the duck confit, was hearty and savory. Top it off with a snicker doodle pancake, and forget your plans you had after that magnificent meal, because napping has become a thing you do now.

If it's your first time, make sure to tell them. It's your first time, and they'll spoil you with a snicker doodle pancake. The coffee is good, it's better when you make it an Irish coffee. Get it with that whip cream that you know you want. Make sure to have breakfast here.",28/7/2017 21:11

I ordered ""eggs and enchiladas"" add avocado. My breakfast was presented with an overly ripened mostly brown avocado. When I requested a replacement the waiter was clearly put out and returned within seconds saying ""this is the best we can do the avocado is simply ""natural"""". Knowing this not to be the case, i requested a new avocado again directly to the cooks (the kitchen is completely open to dining"".) This is the crazy part. Turns out the cook was the owner and RUDELY informed me ""I am not going to waste another avocado on you"". 

The food was decent, but the menu write up about the food was better than the food itself. The food was hot and the vibe good, food so-so and service and customer relations horrific.

I have no idea who Kim S is since our server, and both the person the restaurant portrayed the manager and owner to be were men. Whomever Kim S is she was not involved in any of the discussion or did not speak with us. Furthermore there was no server on the patio named Kim.

(2016). Their menu has a myriad of options, but what caught my eye was the large number of specialty pancakes. Although I wanted to try several of the options, knowing I would only be able to try one during my short vacation I opted with the Oreo Pancakes. The entrï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½e includes two massive Oreo pancakes double stuffed with actual Oreo crï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½me and placed over crï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½me anglaise. Oreo cookie crumbs and whipped cream top it off (I got mine to go, so the whipped cream was on the side and I used it as more of a dip with each sugary bite). These pancakes wowed me and I think I was most impressed by the layer of actual Oreo crï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½me sandwiched between the two pancakes (kind of tough to see in the pics, but trust me it is there in ample supply). Underneath the pancakes was a sea of crï¿½ï¿½ was almost too much, but I really enjoyed it. I think these are the best pancakes I've ever had. The only ones that even come close was the 5Ib ""Elvis"" stack I got at M.A.C. 24/7 in Honolulu, Hawaii a couple years ago (If any of you want to read that review let me know and I'll tag you in it). These pancakes are Doughboy approved and get my highest recommendation (5 Stars)! I'll definitely visit again on my next Tucson trip to try the Birthday Cake, Cinnamon Roll, or Snickerdoodle varieties.

The tortillas were like Ortega packaged tostada shells, the hash browns were crispy on the outside and like  mashed potatoes inside. I think that they must have been rehydrated, they surely were not freshly grated. One person requested no onions in his corned beef hash, it was filled with onions.

Parking: PLENTY of parking at this spot. Certainly there isn't as much traffic given the pandemic but even on a normal business day I imagine that parking would be a non-issue.

Seating: Everything is done on walk up right now but we placed our order online for pick up. Very convenient and a limited wait time.

Service: The team at Baja Cafe was super nice. I checked in with them when we arrived and they actually brought the food out to our car. The one thing that my wife and I thought they could do is add to their phone message that online orders are available. We figured it out but I'm sure that others wouldn't take the time to actually look for it.

Food: DELICIOUS! My wife said this is her new Huevos Rancheros spot :). The King Kong was also very good!

One dining companion ordered the Corned Beef and Eggs and liked her meal. The other dining companion ordered the Barbacoa Huevos Rancheros. She enjoyed it but couldn't finish it since it was a pretty large serving. We also couldn't resist and ordered the Pecan Roll to share.

The bacon was crispy not gross the cheese was creamy the green chilies were just right and the Tomato was cooked perfectly. The hash browns were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and the biscuit was very good. Coffee was hot and my cup was refilled frequently by my excellent server.

Well, this review is just another voice in the chorus of great reviews. Instead of focusing on the restaurant, I'll focus on the specific dishes I ordered - The Roadrunner #5 and Pineapple Express Pancake. 

First up: Roadrunner #5. This dish was delicious from the first bite to the last. It's one of the best vegetarian breakfast dishes I've ever had. It has a variety of savory flavors that compliment each other extremely well. The toppings were partitioned so I was able to choose from different segments of the dish. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked. The gooey yolks added to the mixed flavors on my fork. Super well done! 
The accompanying hash browns had the right amount of moisture and crispiness, and salted just so lightly to bring out the freshness of the shredded potatoes. 
Secondly... For 'dessert' I ordered the Pineapple Express Pancake . It was like a deep dish pancake with an explosion of fruit sweetness on top. The orange brown sugar butter gave a touch of saltiness to offset and balance the sweetness. I was only able to enjoy a few bites in my mouth since the main dish was so plentiful. I'm hoping I can pan heat this tomorrow morning to bring my stomach back to that happy place. 
The wait was about a half hour, but well worth it. Service was 4 of 5 stars. It wasn't for lack of attention as much as having to share our server with so many other tasks and tables. 
The only improvement I could suggest is to get a Yelp Waitlist going at this fine establishment. Oh, and to open one up in Phoenix, pretty please",21/3/2021 1:11

43911,10327,56,5,0,0,0,"This is the ""Must try place for breakfast"".  
Of the three Tucson locations we have eaten at the Broadway (Behind ""Gaslight Theater"", ambience more subdued and service not as good) and the Campbell (Behind ""Old Chicago Pizza"", better ambience and service is awesome) locations.  Food portions are large, price is good (higher for the ""specialty"" ones) and our number one stop for breakfast when in Tucson. We have yet to eat everything on our plates.
The first time we ate there the waiter helped us pick the food. My wife had the ""Georgia Peach French Toast"" which was surprisingly very good and had the right amount of cinnamon and toppings; although I am not typically a ""fruit"" kinda guy I helped eat her breakfast. I ended up picking the ""Coyote"" benedict and while it was good  (I think the chipotle hollandaise sauce threw the taste off slightly for me) I liked the wife's breakfast better.  
Since this was our first time the waiter threw in a ""Snickerdoodle"" pancake for desert. After our breakfast we could not begin to finish this pancake, but our family has enjoyed it as a desert whenever we go back. If you don't try anything else, try the ""Snickerdoodle"" pancake. You won't regret it. 
We have gone back several times and tried different breakfast items and still wanna go back and finish working through the rest of the breakfast menu. Unfortunately, we have not tried lunch here yet, so can't really say what that will be like, but with the quality, portions and loving their breakfast... gotta imagine that would be pretty good as well.",30/10/2018 15:11

We enjoyed a mimosa, pancake combo with Pecan Roll pancake, and waffle combo with  Classic Liege Waffle. 

We noted the deliciousness of the egg and hash browns - typically the eggs and hash browns don't even make it into my review. Not the case at Baja Cafe, the eggs and hash browns were so well done and exactly as I requested. The Pecan Roll pancake was so good, similar to eating a pecan cinnamon role with the BEST candied pecans. The  Classic Liege Waffles is a unique eating experience that you need to embrace. It's a dense waffle with little sugar crystals - almost like eating a really sweet bread - try it. I would not add the syrup until you try it in case you don't want to add the added sugar.

The menu offers something for every palate. If you prefer something sweet then you can't go wrong with their pancakes. They offer many unique creations such as peanut butter with brownie bites and cinnamon roll but Baja is most famous for the snickerdoodle. Eater be warned: bring your ""A"" game appetite and stretchy pants because their pancakes are huge and you'll walk out with a larger waistline.

On the savory side, the biscuits and gravy is a classic. The benedicts are as creative as the pancakes. And their names, such as the Roadrunner 5.0, and its red and green chile flavors, are a tribute to Tucson.

I don't remember specifically what either was, but basically they were both piles of mushy food on plates. Mine had pupusas instead of biscuits and they were not even cooked. They were so mushy they were just masa and the taste/texture was just like eating plain masa. They were not crispy or warm or cheesy, like the menu promised.

There was no textural difference between any of the ingredients on my plate. The flavors were OK at best. Not much seasoning. Over-salted. The coffee was disappointingly-brewed.

44006,3083,56,5,10,5,8,"Whether you're a fan of sweet or savory breakfasts, Baja Cafe has EXACTLY what you're going to love. 

I've been really enjoying takeout brunch from Baja, flipping back and forth between what I think are the two best sections of their breakfast menu: the benedicts and the pancakes. 

My absolute favorite thing so far has been the Carne Tots. The base layer of tater tots sits on a smoked gouda sauce, then is piled with carne asada, spicy bacon, caramelized onions, bell peppers, green chilies. It's topped with two eggs (they recommend poached, but I get fried over hard), salsa verde cruda, cotija cheese, pico de gallo and chipotle aioli. This plate is everything!!! I absolutely love the flavors: smoky and a hint of spicy, with a major punch from the carne asada. This is the type of breakfast that not only keeps you fueled all day, but keeps you dreaming of getting it again. 

Another benedict I really enjoy is the Black Widow. This is a bit lighter and more like a traditional benedict: an English muffin with a herbed cream cheese, topped with sundried tomatoes, braised spinach, mushrooms, caramelized onions, artichoke hearts and two eggs (again, they recommend poached, but I get fried over hard), with basil pesto hollandaise, arugula, and a drizzle of balsamic reduction. This has a Mediterranean flavor profile, and is great for feeling both a smidge healthier but still fully indulgent. 

If you've got a sweet tooth, you can't go wrong with any of their pancakes. The Pecan Roll pancake is the lovechild of pancakes and cinnamon pecan rolls -- you definitely want it. It's a large buttermilk pancake loaded with candied pecans and cinnamon sugar, topped with a swirl of vanilla bean cream cheese glaze. The cinnamon sugar brï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½lï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½es a bit, making a wonderful crunchy crust on the top of the pancake. This pancake with a cup of coffee makes for a dreamy, delicious morning.

I also love the Oreo pancakes, but fair warning: this one is a sugar bomb of galactic proportions. It's two chocolatey Orereo creme and placed over crï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½me Anglaise, then garnished with crumbled Oreos and whipped cream. The whole thing is like a massive soft Oreo, with the two pancakes sandwiching the sugary filling. It's sweet to the point that I couldn't eat even half of it; I had to balance it with some protein so I didn't get jittery from all the sugar. Ohmigawd is it good, though! 

Like I said: it doesn't matter what specifically you're in the mood for at breakfast, I can't recomm",24/5/2021 16:57
44012,4246,56,5,9,6,8,"Oh my, praise your Baja gods, for Baja Cafe is where it's at in Tucson. 

Baja Cafe, after looking over the menu ahead of time, was #1 on my list of places to try in Tucson while I was in town visiting, and after our stop in, I know this cafe will become a regular for myself (as well as my Tucson family). 

We popped into the cafe on Campbell (this location was closer to the events we were filling in the day) on a Monday around 8am.  It was not yet busy, and we were seated immediately - wherever we liked. 

We were asked by our server, Rory, if we had been in before, and found out that first timers receive a snickerdoodle pancake (I had previously looked at pictures of said pancake, and was immediately excited with the prospect of trying it).  

The menu here is so much fun. The names are inventive, the dishes look amazing, and the options are plentiful. Even after ordering, we held onto a menu just to continue looking at the names and options.  I had decided at least a month ago or so that my entree of choice was going to be a Benedict: specifically the Roadrunner [chile tamale cakes, with tomatoes, onions, nopalitos, poached eggs, hollandaise and avocado] an amazing sounding vegetarian dish. And amazing it was. a.m.a.z.i.n.g. I was getting full after eating the first cake + egg, but had to eat as much as I could of the second, because I honestly was addicted. 

My mother and aunt got The Wildcat Pupusa to share - another Benedict that was a combo of 2 pupusas, cheese, habenero chicken, caramelized onions and eggs covered in a tomatillo and red sauce. It looked extremely tasty as well, and they equally enjoyed their dish. Very much so. Painfully so.  The hash browns that came with both dishes were absolute perfection. 

The snickerdoodle pancake, as you would expect, is dangerously delicious. We took turns taking bites between the three of us, and ended up taking the rest home to consume later. Can you imagine anything better than a snickerdoodle... in the form of a pancake? How about Red Velvet? or Chocolate Lava pancake? Baja has them all - and each more dangerous than the last. I cannot wait to try (and share) others in the future. 

Baja Cafe will definitely be a stop I make again. As often as possible. I wish to share this amazing establishment with as many close friends and family that I can. Do not miss out on this great opportunity for a wonderful and highly addictive meal. You'll quickly fall deeply in love as well.",14/6/2016 0:53

I was not super astounded by anything, the Huevos Rancheros plate I had was good but nondescript- it was fine, just the flavor to it wasn't outrageously amazing. I don't really remember much of anything except for the fact that, it being my first visit to the location, I was given a free pancake with a sweet sauce layered on top, and I really enjoyed it. My dad did not enjoy his pancake as much and he felt kind of blah about his breakfast. But I am intrigued to return and try more and check it out. They offer a free meal to people who have returned from service, so this is a very vet-friendly establishment.",1/2/2018 22:57

44035,25597,56,5,5,1,3,"This place is a staple of Tucson. I have to come back here any time I visit or bring a friend who's never been to Tucson. 

Baja Cafe has the best selection of eggs benedict. Hands down. Theres no competition. And I'm not talking about your classic poached egg, hollandaise sauce, and English muffin. Depending on what you order, the Benedict's can have avocado, duck, smoked/pulled pork or chicken, chorizo, veggies, and some house sauces that are extremely tasty. They also have a new featured benedict each week. These are some of the best that you can get. I had an empanada benedict with pulled pork when it was their featured one, and it was amazing. 
And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Their pancakes are absolutely delicious (snickerdoodle, cinnamon swirl), their Belgian waffles are to die for, and if you're still not excited, they have a dish called the ""KingKong"" that is a meat lovers dream. And if I remember correctly, they smoke all their meats in house.

All of their food is jam packed with flavor and no matter what you're feeling, sweet or savory, they will definitely have something for you. 

If I haven't convinced you to go there yet, well then you must not have any tastebuds or salivary glands.",5/10/2017 6:10

Asked him for outside seating because inside was way too loud-2 open tables but quoted ""30 minutes.""
I wonder if they have the music loud so people won't converse-just eat and get out...
Sad, because they used to be a favorite breakfast place of mine.",24/4/2021 20:53
44055,6662,56,5,0,0,1,"Worth the wait. I had eaten at Baja at it's mother location on Broadway, and it has since been years since trying again. Not because of the food or experience but 100% due to my busy schedule. 

My boyfriend is new to Tucson, discovered Prep and Pastry and had not tried anywhere new in town. One Saturday morning, I decided to push him to try out another place for brunch and he mentioned lets try Baja since it's still close by on Campbell. 

I arrived first between us, was told the wait would be 15 minutes, for how busy the place looked. We ended up waiting 1 hour, which frustrated us but we had waited long enough to stubbornly wait out till we got to sit, order and eat. Now I'm a hangry person. I was getting cranky and impatient and we both had went up to the host a total of 4 times in regards to checking our place in line status. Once seated, we ordered our individual meals (I got a benedict and my lovely boyfriend got a huevos rancheros) and we split a simple, buttermilk pancake. Now the food wait was typical, but that being said, typical for a busy place, still about 20 minutes on top of our hour wait. 

Finally. The food arrive. You would think between the two of us we hadn't seen food for days by hour quickly we dug into our meals. Needless to say, after putting up with me on the wait, and trying a new place, said boyfriend was very happy with the food. 

Yes, brunch lines are expected to be long. That's why overall, I was not upset with the typical time to wait. And graciously, the food lived up to both the hype and made our long, awaited experience fantastic. This might be his new Prep and Pastry go-to brunch place.",4/3/2020 23:22
44060,5231,56,5,4,1,1,"Hello friend! 
Hey, how's life? Has watching the news been too much negative energy lately? (Big yes) Has Covid-19 cancelled your hotly-anticipated summer vaca to Europe? (Me too) Does 2020 feel too much like the beginning of Zombieland and you're currently brushing up on Columbus' rules? (Always double-tap!)

If you answered yes, or no, to any of these questions, I feel ya. The struggle is real. But hey, there is a remedy...breakfast. Yes, breakfast. And if I'm talking breakfast in Tucson, I'm talking Baja Cafe. 

Baja has all your traditional breakfast dishes you know and love but skillfully makes each dish uniquely their own. Cinnamon roll pancakes. Liege waffles. Brisket machaca. An entire page of eggs benedict selections that have it all and then some. Eggs benny over tamale pie. Or how about with Mac n cheese and brisket? Or over brisket caramelos? A lot of creative dishes. I've tried almost all their benedicts and each has its own unique flavor and taste. And if you can't make up your mind on what to get, there's the King Kong that throws everything breakfast into a big stack so you don't miss out on any of it. Idk the minds behind these dishes but thank you Baja mad scientist chef person(s). 

Service has always been friendly and helpful. It is a very busy place and there's normally a wait for dine-in. Worth the wait but there's also take-out if you want to go home and eat in bed. Don't judge!

This got way longer than I meant it to be so in short, choose breakfast. Vote Baja Cafe 2020. 5/5*",28/9/2020 5:02

The food is very delicious bursting with flavor !! It was my first time here today and I am already looking forward to coming back to try out other options! Menu items we tried were the Wolverine Benedict , the lemon blueberry pancakes , the classic huevos rancheros and kids menu items .. everything was awesome and the portions were generous !! Very fulfilling so can be easily shared ! Plus the prices are very reasonable! So please give this local joint a try for some of the best flavors Tucson has to offer ! One more thing I would like to add is that since we don't eat pork , they substituted a turkey sausage for me which tasted  really good on my Benedict !! Two thumbs up !",13/9/2020 21:11
44072,4389,56,5,4,1,2,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Baja Cafe truly lived up to the hype. Once you've experienced their food for yourself, it'll all make sense as to why they opened up at a second location. The staff is friendly and always with a smile, and very accommodating no matter how large your group is.

Something amazing about their menu is the frequency of its unique off the menu specials, typically based off of some sort of local event (most recently, menus themed off of the UA graduation for 2016). They have all the breakfast/brunch type items you'd expect at such a dining location, but in my opinion their claim to fame is the extensive selection of benedicts.

Today I ordered the Duck Confit Benedict. The duck was juicy, moist, and extremely flavorful, something that impressed me as duck can be easily overcooked and dried out. The decadent saltiness of the duck was mellowed out by the earthy black bean purï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½e and simple salsa of tomatoes and onions, all atop polenta cakes. Oh, and they side of breakfast hash browns, because, potatoes! When mixed together with the creamy yolk (which oozed out perfectly when I gently split it with my knife) of the poached eggs, all the flavor married together marvelously. 

And if that wasn't enough to convince you, first timers get a free pancake! Anyways, you're missing out if you haven't tried this joint out yet. Get in quick before the word gets too far out and they're eternally packed out the door!",20/5/2016 22:20
44075,4217,56,5,0,0,1,"Want a mind blowing Benedict?!? Come here! I had the Black Widow Benedict and it was incredible. Packed with so many veggies (red peppers, artichokes, spinach to name a few), goat cheese, hollandaise, & balsamic placed upon a puff pastry. The only warning is that it is MASSIVE and could definitely be split between 2-3 people.

The service was great and so was the coffee. I would definitely come back!",6/3/2020 16:06
